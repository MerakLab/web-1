## Introduction

Far too often we do not know what our [SNV, SAAV, and SCV]({{ site.url
}}/2015/07/20/analyzing-variability/) data mean. The problem is that our data output is nucleotide
sequence, which is although defines the blueprint for function, is a very abstracted output from
what we are trying to learn about. As eloquently put by [Harms and
Thornton](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4418793/), as a practical convenience, we as
evolutionary biologists have a tendency to "*treat molecular sequences as mere strings of letters,
the patterns of which carry the traces of historical processes, rather than as functioning objects
for which the physical properties determine their behaviour*". It is from these patterns that we can
learn so much by analyzing variant data derived from metagenomes. However, given that the
SNV/SAAV/SCV (I'll just call them variants from now on) patterns by themselves offer zero insight
into fitness, within our field, variant data is most commonly used to identify and track "strains".
In other words, variant data becomes a tool for tracking ecological processes, and less so a tool
for identifying functional variants.

To bridge a gap between metagenomic sequence variants and the structural biology of gene products
that underpin function and fitness is no easy task, but I think its critical if we want empower the
our findings with biochemical information. (As a small step in this direction, Ã–zcan, Meren, and I developed
[anvi-3dev]({{ site.url }}/software/anvi-3dev), a way to visualize metagenomic sequence variants
directly on predicted protein structures).

On this front, one of the most transformative talks I have ever attended was given by Dr. Mona Singh about [this
paper](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/2/582/5232439) (Kobren and Singh, 2018). Kobren and
Singh took every Pfam family and searched for whether or not any members of the family had
crystalized structures that co-complexed with bound ligands. If so, then they calculated 3D distance
scores of each residue to the ligand(s) and used these distances as an inverse proxy for binding
likelihood (the more likely you are to be involved in the binding of a ligand, the close you are in
physical space to the ligand). They aggregated the totality of these results and ended up with thousands of Pfam
IDs for which they could attribute per-residue ligand-binding scores to the Pfam's associated HMM.
They used this to further characterize the human proteome, however when I was listening to the talk
all I was thinking about was applying it to metagenomics.


They entitled their software, *InteracDome*, and there is an [online
server](https://interacdome.princeton.edu/) where you can give an amino acid sequence, and their
server will run an HMM of your sequence against the InteracDome database and attribute estimated
binding scores for each residue in your sequence. That is basically exactly what I wanted to do,
except for a massive number of genes that may typically found in [anvi'o contigs databases]({{
site.url }}/software/anvio/help/artifacts/contigs-db/). Furthermore, I wanted to store all the
information in the contigs database for further data analysis and visualization, as is the anvi'o
way.

So that is what this post is about. Basically, it is a technical description of the implementation
details of putting InteracDome into anvi'o. It's not a tutorial, but at the end there will be an
example (so maybe it is a tutorial). It's sort of an experimental post because I will not be shying
away from sharing code snippets from the codebase, so if you're code-shy, this is your trigger
warning.

## A general map of the approach

Here are the bird's-eye-view requirements I constrained myself by in order to implement InteracDome into anvi'o:

1. We need to provide means to store a local copy of InteracDome's [tab-separated files](https://interacdome.princeton.edu/#tab-6136-4)
2. We need an HMM database that the contig database's genes are searched against
3. We need to run an HMM
4. We need to parse the output
4. We need to filter HMM results based on hit-quality criteria
5. We need to match the InteracDome binding frequencies of the HMM to the gene sequences
6. We need to store the per-residue binding frequencies of genes

## anvi-setup-interacdome

If you notice, (1) and (2) are just setup, and so I created a program called
`anvi-setup-interacdome` to handle both downloading InteracDome's tab-separated values, and created
an HMM database that contains all the HMM profiles associated to each Pfam in the InteracDome
dataset.

What are these tab-separated files, you say? Well they contain the binding frequencies associated to
each match-state (read as: residue) of the HMM. Here is what one looks like:

| pfam_id                 | domain_length | ligand_type  | num_nonidentical_instances | num_structures | binding_frequencies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

You can see that the `binding_frequencies` column contains per residue scores from 0 to 1 that say
how likely a given residue is to be involved in binding. Also notice that the `ligand_type` varies
and you can have multiple ligands for a given Pfam. These files give what is the essential output of
the InteracDome workflow, and there are two of them. The first is the non-redundant representable
set, which "*correspond to domain-ligand interactions that had nonredundant instances across three
or more distinct PDB structures. [Kobren and Singh] recommend using this collection to learn more
about domain binding properties*". If I recall, there are 2375 such Pfam IDs in this set (this is
compared to the roughly 15,000-20,000 total Pfam IDs). The second set is the confident set, which
"*correspond to domain-ligand interactions that had nonredundant instances across three or more
distinct PDB entries and achieved a cross-validated precision of at least 0.5. [Kobren and Singh]
recommend using this collection to annotate potential ligand-binding positions in protein
sequences*".

These InteracDome datasets, along with their associated HMM profiles, are the essential required
input for running InteracDome in anvi'o. And to make these inputs available to the user, the user
must run `anvi-setup-interacdome` which initiates a class called `InteracdomeSetup`. Here is the
class:

First, anvi'o creates a directory under `anvio/data/misc/Interacdome` (by default) which will end up
housing the HMMs and the Interacdome datasets. Then the main method, `setup` is called, which is directly above us. We can see
that first, anvi'o downloads the tab-separated files. Since these files were created for Pfam
version `31.0`, anvi'o next downloads a copy of the Pfam `31.0` HMMs. There already exists a
framework to download Pfams because of `anvi-setup-pfams`, so this was very little work to do. Yay for
code resusability. As a final step, the Pfam HMMs are subset to include only the Pfam IDs that are
in the Interacdome dataset. This required writing a parser for `.hmm` files (ugh).
