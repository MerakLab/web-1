This tutorial is a work-in-progress. However, we wish to improve it as soon as possible, and please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions.

{% include _toc.html %}

How many times have you analyzed a genome or metagenome and found a large proportion of the genes have no annotation?

Have you ever been interested in characterizing a bacterial genomic locus but contains a critical gene with no reliable homology?

Well it turns out that 40%-60% of genes predicted from microbiome have no significant homology to nucleotide databases and it's only getting worse as we sequence more and more microbiomes from around the globe! But don't worry,  **[AGNOSTOS](https://github.com/functional-dark-side/agnostos-wf)** is a great way to address the questions above and utilize all genes, Known and Unknown, from microbiomes! ([Vanni et al., 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.180448v5)) 

Recently, Vanni et al., 2021 published the preprint [Unifying the known and unknown microbial coding sequence space](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.180448v5) showcasing [AGNOSTOS](https://github.com/functional-dark-side/agnostos-wf), the output of which described the unknown sequence landscape of microbiomes from the ocean and human body. Excitingly, it illuminated thousands of lineage-specific genes of unknown function in the CPR superphylum Patescibacteria. To accompany the [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.180448v5), [Antonio Fernandez-Guerra](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8679-490X) wrote a blog post that goes over the origins of [AGNOSTOS](https://github.com/functional-dark-side/agnostos-wf) (10 years in the making), the categories of gene-clusters that result from the workflow, and the future of unknown genes in microbiomes. We highly recommend reading the [blog post](http://merenlab.org/2020/07/01/dark-side/#a-conceptual-framework-to-unify-the-known-and-the-unknown-in-microbiome-analyses) for a casual introduction into utilizing the genes of unknown function genes from microbiomes.
	
One of the goals of this [Vanni et al., 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.180448v5) was to provide resources	 ([AGNOSTOS](https://github.com/functional-dark-side/agnostos-wf) and AGNOSTOS-DB) for the science community to explore genes of unknown function in their own microbial genomic and metagenomic sequencing data. To accomplish this, we have composed the tutorial below showing how to integrate the workflow's output from [Vanni et al., 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.180448v1) into your anvi'o projects!

<div class="extra-info" markdown="1">
<span class="extra-info-header"> Here's a brief recap of the AGNOSTOS gene annotation categories discussed in Antonio's [blog post](https://merenlab.org/2020/07/01/dark-side/#a-conceptual-framework-to-unify-the-known-and-the-unknown-in-microbiome-analyses):
- **Known with Pfam annotations**: genes annotated to contain one or more Pfam entries (domain, family, repeats or motifs) but excluding the domains of unknown function (DUF)
- **Known without Pfam annotations**: which contains the genes that have a known function but lack a Pfam annotation. Here we can find intrinsically disordered proteins or small proteins among others.
- **Genomic unknown**: genes that have an unknown function (DUF are included here) and found in sequenced or draft genomes
- **Environmental unknown**: genes of unknown function not detected in sequenced or draft genomes, but only in environmental metagenomes or metagenome-assembled genomes.
</div>

The purpose of this blog post is to give an introduction to how you can utilize the unknown fraction of genes in microbiomes using the output of the [AGNOSTOS](https://github.com/functional-dark-side/agnostos-wf) in anvi'o. Throughout the tutorial, we will use [the Infant Gut Dataset](https://merenlab.org/tutorials/infant-gut/) (IGD) as an example project from [Sharon et al., 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22936250). First, however, you should follow these instructions to get the necessary information from an anvi'o project to annotate your genes with AGNOSTOS categories.

To start, please first follow the download instructions in the IGD tutorial [here](https://merenlab.org/tutorials/infant-gut/#downloading-the-pre-packaged-infant-gut-dataset) to get the {% include ARTIFACT name="contigs-db" text="contigs database" %} in your working directory. If you can list the following files in your working directory, then you are good to follow the rest of the tutorial:

```bash
$ ls
AUXILIARY-DATA.db  CONTIGS.db  PROFILE.db  additional-files/
```

{:.warning}
If you want to go straight to data analysis, skip ahead to [Download the goods](http://localhost:4000/2021/05/28/agnostos/#download-the-goods). However, if you are interested in integrating AGNOSTOS annotations into your own anvi'o {% include ARTIFACT name="contigs-db" text="contigs database" %} then keep reading.


## Running AGNOSTOS with data from anvi'o

{:.notice}
This section is only necessary if you want to run the [AGNOSTOS](https://github.com/functional-dark-side/agnostos-wf) on your data. On the other hand, if your purpose is to see how AGNOSTOS output can be integrated into an anvi'o project, you can skip this step and use our pre-computed output files generated by AGNOSTOS here: [Download the goods section](http://localhost:4000/2021/05/28/agnostos/#download-the-goods). 

### Extracting data from anvi'o
	
The purpose of this section is to demonstrate how to extract the necessary data files from an anvi'o project to run the [AGNOSTOS](https://github.com/functional-dark-side/agnostos-wf). The first step is to export the gene sequences from the {% include ARTIFACT name="contigs-db" text="contigs database" %} using the anvi'o program {% include PROGRAM name="anvi-get-sequences-for-gene-calls" %}:

```bash
anvi-get-sequences-for-gene-calls -c CONTIGS.db \
                                  --get-aa-sequences \
                                  -o infant_gut_genes.fasta
```

Next, we need the gene completion information i.e. does a gene contain both a start and stop codon? This can be found in the {% include ARTIFACT name="gene-calls-txt" %} which can be extracted from your {% include ARTIFACT name="contigs-db" text="contigs database" %}. To do this, we can use the program {% include PROGRAM name="anvi-export-gene-calls" %}:

```bash
anvi-export-gene-calls -c CONTIGS.db \
                       --gene-caller prodigal \
                       -o infant_gut_gene_calls.tsv
```

And that's it!

At this point, we have all the necessary files to run the [AGNOSTOS-workflow](https://github.com/functional-dark-side/agnostos-wf), namely the gene amino acid sequences (`infant_gut_genes.fasta`) and the gene completion information (`infant_gut_gene_calls.tsv`).

### Running AGNOSTOS

The purpose of this section is to demonstrate different ways of utilizing AGNOSTOS depending on the computational resources you have available and the kind of information you want to learn about your unknown sequences. The easiest way to take advantage of AGNOSTOS is to run a profile search of the AGNOSTOS-DB clusters against predicted ORFs from your sequencing data. This will quickly annotate your sequences and tell you about the landscape of your unknown sequencing space. Additionally, you can leverage the metadata associated with each AGNOSTOS cluster annotation, including its lineage specificity, niche breadth, etc.

However, running [AGNOSTOS](https://github.com/functional-dark-side/agnostos-wf) integrates your sequences into the AGNOSTOS-DB clusters or potentially creates new clusters if your genomes and metagenome have novel homologous sequences (go read about that [here](https://merenlab.org/2020/07/01/dark-side/#why-gene-clusters)). The concept of ORF integration is key here because we are not trying to annotate the IGD ORFs.  Instead, we are attempting to insert the IGD ORFs into the extant AGNOSTOS clusters that already have metadata associated with them (read more about it [here](http://merenlab.org/2020/07/01/dark-side/#why-gene-clusters)). Thus, integration allows for the entire dataset of ORFs to be used rather than alignment-based methods where one filters for best hits. 

The [AGNOSTOS-workflow](https://github.com/functional-dark-side/agnostos-wf) is a complex workflow that relies on many external dependencies. Furthermore, to achieve high sensitivity levels, some of their steps are computationally expensive for large datasets. Currently,[AGNOSTOS](https://github.com/functional-dark-side/agnostos-wf), although fully functional on an HPC, should be considered proof of concept of what can be done and we are working to make it more accessible. This tutorial is the starting point for our plans to integrate an optimized version of AGNOSTOS into anvi'o.

Regardless of which way you decided to use AGNOSTOS we will visualize the data in the next section.


#### Easy mode - quickly annotated sequences with AGNOSTOS categories

Here we will quickly annotate the IGD dataset with AGNOSTOS categories, download the AGNOSTOS-DB profiles and cluster categories

First, download the AGNOSTOS-DB profiles and cluster categories here:

```bash
wget https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/23066963 -O IGD_agnostos/clu_hmm_db

wget https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/23067140 -O IGD_agnostos/cluster_ids_categ.tsv
```

Next, run the profile search.

{:.warning}
Please conda install [mmseqs2](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2#installation) to run this profile search

```bash
Profile_search/profile_search.sh --query infant_gut_genes.fasta \
			         --clu_hmm clu_hmm_db \
			         --clu_cat cluster_ids_categ.tsv \
			         --threads 10
```

#### Hard mode - integrate sequences into AGNOSTOS-DB


{:.notice}
AGNOSTOS is designed to run on an HPC environment not a standard laptop computer. Please your local bioinformatician wizard for installation

Installation instructions for [AGNOSTOS](https://github.com/functional-dark-side/agnostos-wf) can be found [here](https://github.com/functional-dark-side/agnostos-wf/blob/master/AGNOSTOS_usage.md). Once you've completed the installation on your HPC come back here and continue the tutorial. 

FIXME: need explanation that user needs to go to the AGNOSTOS repo to get this going

## Download the goods


This section will go over how to integrate and visualize AGNOSTOS categories in your anvi'o projects. To have some fun, [Chiara Vanni](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1124-1147) kindly integrated all of the ORFs from the IGD metagenomes using  [AGNOSTOS](https://github.com/functional-dark-side/agnostos-wf). Additionally, she integrated the ORFs from 6 *E. faecalis* so we can investigate AGNOSTOS categories in the context of a pangenome. 

Please download these files to start the analysis:
```bash
# Make a home for the AGNOSTOS data
mkdir -p IGD_agnostos

# Download AGNOSTOS integrated IGD metagenomic
# FIXME: need updated link to data with classified SINGL
wget https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/27896625 -O IGD_agnostos/IGD_genes_summary_info_exp.tsv

# Download AGNOSTOS integrated E. faecalis genomes
wget https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/24028730 -O IGD_agnostos/IGD_ext_genomes_summary_info_exp.tsv
```

{:.notice}
Check out a description of the AGNOSTOS data file columns in the file [here](https://github.com/functional-dark-side/agnostos-wf/blob/master/Output_README.md).

Now you are ready to import the AGNOSTOS output for your genes back into your anvi'o project.

## Import AGNOSTOS into an anvi'o

You should have your AGNOSTOS data tables or have downloaded the pre-calculated datasets above at this point in the tutorial. Now it's time to get the AGNOSTOS data back into anvi'o. The first step will be to import the data as {% include ARTIFACT name="functions" text="functions" %} into the IGD {% include ARTIFACT name="contigs-db" text="contigs database" %} (check out this [post](http://merenlab.org/2016/06/18/importing-functions/) if you have more questions about anvi'o functions tables). This will make it easy to explore the AGNOSTOS categories in the context of assembled contigs and read recruitment results in the anvi'o interactive interface!
 

Import AGNOSTOS data into the IGD {% include ARTIFACT name="contigs-db" text="contigs database" %}:
```bash
anvi-import-functions -c CONTIGS.db -p agnostos -i IGD_agnostos/IGD_genes_summary_info_exp.tsv
```

## Metagenomics applications

Now that we have imported the AGNOSTOS categories into our {% include ARTIFACT name="contigs-db" text="contigs database" %}, let's check out the distribution of categories in the IGD metagenome dataset:

```bash
$ tail -n+2 IGD_agnostos/IGD_genes_summary_info_exp.tsv | cut -f 6 | sort | uniq -c
2851 DISC
3926 EU
4506 GU
18576 K
2406 KWP
   9 NA
```

FIXME: description of this distribution of AGNOSTOS categories

FIXME: If you are interested in cluster validation, check out the explanation [here](https://dark.metagenomics.eu/cluster-validation)

Now we can leverage these categories to explore Unknowns in metagenomic-assembled genomes (MAGs)! 

First, let's import some bins Meren made:
```
anvi-import-collection additional-files/collections/merens.txt \
                       --bins-info additional-files/collections/merens-info.txt \
                       -p PROFILE.db \
                       -c CONTIGS.db \
                       -C default
```

{:.notice}
In this analysis, we are not using Singleton genes; however, the AGNOTOS-workflow does classify these genes. FIXME

Now because we already imported the AGNOSTOS output into anvi'o, we can immediately visualize the results like this:
```
anvi-interactive -p PROFILE.db -c CONTIGS.db -F Agnostos
```

## Pangenomic applications

{:.warning}
We are working on this section! Once we are done, this section will include instructions to add a proportion of AGNOSTOS categories for each gene cluster in a given anvi'o pangenome as a layer:

# Conclusion

The AGNOSTOS workflow from [Vanni et al., 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.180448v1) provides a path forward to utilizing all genes from microbiomes and integrates seamlessly into your standard metagenomic or pangenomic workflow as seen above using anvi'o. We hope this brief introduction will catalyze your future microbiomes analyses!
