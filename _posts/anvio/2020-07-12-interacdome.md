## Who is this post for?

This post is like a technical diary for my implementation of InteracDome into anvi'o. The primary purpose of this
is to provide all the technical details in one place, so that (1) people who inevitably use this
in anvi'o know what is going on under the hood, and (2) so people digging into the codebase
for debugging or extending features understand why I made certain decisons. It is thus a very
technical blog post, and is quite distinct from other stuff we write about. But if you think you may
be interested, by all means read :)! Just keep in mind that I will not be shying away from sharing
code snippets from the codebase, so if you're code-shy, this is your trigger warning.

## Introduction

Far too often we do not know what our [SNV, SAAV, and SCV]({{ site.url
}}/2015/07/20/analyzing-variability/) data mean. The problem is that our data output is nucleotide
sequence, which although defines the blueprint for function, is a very abstracted output from
what we are trying to learn about. As eloquently put by [Harms and
Thornton](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4418793/), as a practical convenience, we as
evolutionary biologists have a tendency to "*treat molecular sequences as mere strings of letters,
the patterns of which carry the traces of historical processes, rather than as functioning objects
for which the physical properties determine their behaviour*". It is from these patterns that we can
learn so much by analyzing variant data derived from metagenomes. However, given that the
SNV/SAAV/SCV (I'll just call them variants from now on) patterns by themselves offer zero insight
into fitness, within our field, variant data is most commonly used to identify and track "strains".
And to be honest, that saddens me because there is so much more potential than using them as mere
markers.

To bridge a gap between metagenomic sequence variants and the structural biology of gene products
that underpin function and fitness is no easy task, but I think its critical if we want empower the
our findings with biochemical information. (As a small step in this direction, Ã–zcan, Meren, and I developed
[anvi-3dev]({{ site.url }}/software/anvi-3dev), a way to visualize metagenomic sequence variants
directly on predicted protein structures).

On this front, one of the most transformative talks I have ever attended was given by Dr. Mona Singh about [this
paper](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/2/582/5232439) (Kobren and Singh, 2018). Kobren and
Singh took every Pfam family and searched for whether or not any members of the family had
crystalized structures that co-complexed with bound ligands. If so, then they calculated 3D distance
scores of each residue to the ligand(s) and used these distances as an inverse proxy for binding
likelihood (the more likely you are to be involved in the binding of a ligand, the close you are in
physical space to the ligand). They aggregated the totality of these results and ended up with thousands of Pfam
IDs for which they could attribute per-residue ligand-binding scores to the Pfam's associated HMM.
They used this to further characterize the human proteome, however when I was listening to the talk
all I was thinking about was applying it to metagenomics.

They entitled their software, *InteracDome*, and there is an [online
server](https://interacdome.princeton.edu/) where you can give an amino acid sequence, and their
server will run an HMM of your sequence against the InteracDome database and attribute estimated
binding scores for each residue in your sequence. That is basically exactly what I wanted to do,
except for a massive number of genes that may typically found in [anvi'o contigs databases]({{
site.url }}/software/anvio/help/artifacts/contigs-db/). Furthermore, I wanted to store all the
information in the contigs database for further data analysis and visualization, as is the anvi'o
way.


## Breaking it down into (6) components

Here are the bird's-eye-view components of InteracDome's implementation into anvi'o:

1. Storing a local copy of InteracDome's [tab-separated files](https://interacdome.princeton.edu/#tab-6136-4)
2. Storing the HMM profiles that the contig database's genes are searched against
3. Running the HMM
4. Parsing HMMER's standard output file
4. Filtering HMM hits
5. Matching the InteracDome binding frequencies of the HMM match states to the gene's residues
6. Storing the per-residue binding frequencies into the contigs database

## (1) and (2): Storing copy of the InteracDome datasets and the corresponding HMM profiles

### Description of tab-separated InteracDome files

What are these tab-separated files, you say? Well they contain the binding frequencies associated to
each match-state (read as: residue) of the HMM. Here is what one looks like:

| pfam_id                 | domain_length | ligand_type  | num_nonidentical_instances | num_structures | binding_frequencies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

You can see that the `binding_frequencies` column contains per residue scores from 0 to 1 that say
how likely a given residue is to be involved in binding. Each value is comma separated and there are
as many values as there are match states in the HMM. That means the number of values in
`binding_frequencies` matches the value of `domain_length`. Also notice that the `ligand_type` varies
and you can have multiple ligands for a given Pfam. These files give what is the essential output of
the InteracDome workflow, and there are two of them. The first is the non-redundant representable
set, which "*correspond to domain-ligand interactions that had nonredundant instances across three
or more distinct PDB structures. [Kobren and Singh] recommend using this collection to learn more
about domain binding properties*". If I recall, there are 2375 such Pfam IDs in this set (this is
compared to the roughly 15,000-20,000 total Pfam IDs). The second set is the confident set, which
"*correspond to domain-ligand interactions that had nonredundant instances across three or more
distinct PDB entries and achieved a cross-validated precision of at least 0.5. [Kobren and Singh]
recommend using this collection to annotate potential ligand-binding positions in protein
sequences*".


### Description of the HMM profiles

Since each entry in the InteracDome dataset corresponds to a Pfam, we just need the Pfam database
that can be readily downloaded from the EBI ftp server, or by running `anvi-setup-pfams`. But since
all the Pfams are not present in the InteracDome dataset, we merely need a subset of the Pfam HMM
database that contains Pfams with at least one entry from the non-redundant representable
InteracDome set. From now on **I'll just call this subset the Interacdome Pfams (IPfams)**.
Furthermore, InteracDome was carried out using Pfam `31.0`, so that's what we will use too.

### anvi-setup-interacdome

Acquiring the InteracDome's tab-separated files and the IPfam HMM profiles are just one-time setups,
and therefore I created a program called [`anvi-setup-interacdome`]({{ site.url
}}/software/anvio/help/programs/anvi-setup-interacdome/) to handle these tasks. So to make these
inputs available, the user must run [`anvi-setup-interacdome`]({{ site.url
}}/software/anvio/help/programs/anvi-setup-interacdome/) which initiates a class called
`InteracdomeSetup`. Here is the class:

First, anvi'o creates a directory under `anvio/data/misc/Interacdome` (by default) which will end up
housing the IPfam HMM profiles and the Interacdome datasets. Then the main method, `setup` is
called, which is directly above us. We can see that first, anvi'o downloads the tab-separated files.
Since these files were created for Pfam version `31.0`, anvi'o next downloads a copy of the Pfam
`31.0` HMMs. There already exists a framework to download Pfams because of `anvi-setup-pfams`, so
this was very little work to do. Yay for code resusability. As a final step, the Pfam HMMs are
subset to the IPfam HMMs, i.e. only the Pfams that are in the Interacdome dataset.

## (3) Running the hidden Markov model (HMM)

{:.warning}
HMMs are by no means an elementary topic, and so rather than butcher an
explanation with my limited understanding, I defer to this [wonderful
paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1672022904020145).

With both the required inputs being gathered and setup appropriately with
[`anvi-setup-interacdome`]({{ site.url }}/software/anvio/help/programs/anvi-setup-interacdome/), the
next thing I focused on was actually running an HMM on user genes. This as well as all the other
components will be carried out by the program [`anvi-run-interacdome`]({{ site.url
}}/software/anvio/help/programs/anvi-run-interacdome/).

The program that goes hand-in-hand with Pfam HMM profiles is
[HMMER](http://eddylab.org/software/hmmer/Userguide.pdf), and in fact, anvi'o already has a driver
to run HMMER on a set of user genes which was written for [`anvi-run-pfams`]({{ site.url
}}/software/anvio/help/programs/anvi-run-pfams/). Further in fact(?), [`anvi-run-pfams`]({{ site.url
}}/software/anvio/help/programs/anvi-run-pfams/) in some ways does exactly what I want: it takes
genes from the contigs database, runs an HMM model of the user genes against the Pfam HMM profiles,
and annotates genes with the best Pfam hit. The primary difference between
[`anvi-run-interacdome`]({{ site.url }}/software/anvio/help/programs/anvi-run-interacdome/) and
[`anvi-run-pfams`]({{ site.url }}/software/anvio/help/programs/anvi-run-pfams/), is that rather than
simply attribute to each gene the Pfam ID of the best hit, we instead must keep track of
residue-level information associated to each hit, so that we can associate the binding
frequencies from the Interacdome dataset. In this sense, things are much more complicated, as I will
need to write an in-depth parser of HMMER's output to keep track of these things.

Currently, [`anvi-run-pfams`]({{ site.url }}/software/anvio/help/programs/anvi-run-pfams/) can be
run with either of the HMMER programs, `hmmscan` or `hmmsearch`. However, for [good
reason](https://cryptogenomicon.org/2011/05/27/hmmscan-vs-hmmsearch-speed-the-numerology/),
`hmmsearch` in practice runs much faster for querying user genes against a HMM profile database with
a size comparable to the Pfam database. Since `hmmsearch` is faster for our use-case and because I
wanted to avoid creating 2 output parsers (one for `hmmscan` and one for `hmmsearch`),
`anvi-run-interacdome` is by design only compatible with `hmmsearch`.

All in all, [`anvi-run-interacdome`]({{ site.url
}}/software/anvio/help/programs/anvi-run-interacdome/) runs `hmmsearch` almost exactly like
[`anvi-run-pfams`]({{ site.url }}/software/anvio/help/programs/anvi-run-pfams/) does. In fact,
the responsible class for [`anvi-run-interacdome`]({{ site.url
}}/software/anvio/help/programs/anvi-run-interacdome/), `anvio.interacdome.InteracdomeSuper`,
inherits `anvio.pfam.Pfam` to manage a lot of the boiler-plate code.

{:.notice}
I chose to apply the HMMER filter parameter `--cut_ga` that uses the Pfam GA (gathering threshold)
score cutoffs to pre-filter the output of `hmmsearch`. This cuts out a lot of crap to sift through.

## (4) Parsing HMMER's standard output file

`hmmsearch` has 2 outputs. One is a tabular output like this:

```

The format is tabularized and thus easy enough to parse, but unfortunately the information is not
detailed enough since it contains no information about residue-by-residue alignment. The second,
more verbose output, does:

To write the parser I made extensive use of the detailed output description in the [HMMER user
guide](http://eddylab.org/software/hmmer/Userguide.pdf) (search for "*Step 2: search the sequence
database with hmmsearch*") for the relevant section. I won't reiterate the meaning of each line, so
check the guide if you're keen. The most important thing to note is that this more verbose output
contains the **sam** tabular information as the first output (albeit in more scattered fashion), and
additionally has alignments of the HMM profile to the query gene.

Consider this section of the output:

```
Query:       2-Hacid_dh  [M=134]
Accession:   PF00389.29
Description: D-isomer specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase, catalytic domain
Scores for complete sequences (score includes all domains):
   --- full sequence ---   --- best 1 domain ---    -#dom-
    E-value  score  bias    E-value  score  bias    exp  N  Sequence Description
    ------- ------ -----    ------- ------ -----   ---- --  -------- -----------
    8.8e-20   68.1   0.1    1.2e-19   67.7   0.1    1.1  1  3609
      2e-10   37.8   0.0    3.6e-10   37.0   0.0    1.5  1  5374
```

I will refer to this as the *domain hits summary*. In this case, the IPfam `PF00389.29` hit to 2 user genes: `3609` and `5374`. Then, for each of these
genes, we can find further down in the file the alignment of each. For example, here is where the
alignment info for gene `3609` starts:

```
>> 3609
   #    score  bias  c-Evalue  i-Evalue hmmfrom  hmm to    alifrom  ali to    envfrom  env to     acc

I will refer to this as the *hit alignment*. The aggregation of **all** the domain hit summaries and the
hit alignments are stored in two datastructures that are attributes of the `anvio.parers.hmmer.HMMERStandardOutput`
parser class. I will now describe both of them:

The first is `dom_hits`, which is a dataframe which looks like this:

It stores all the domain hit information in the domain hit summaries as well as the sequence of the
consensus match states, the comparison string, and the sequence of the user gene. This table
contains all essential information, however the alignment information is in the form of raw strings.
To further process the alignment info into a more meaningful form, there is a second data structure
called `ali_info`. `ali_info` is a nested dictionary. It looks like this:

```
ali_info = {
    # here is the template
    <gene_callers_id>: {
        (<pfam_id>, <domain_id>): {
            <a_dataframe_with_alignment_info>
        },
    },
    # here is an example
    1699: {
        ('PF07972', 1): {
            <a_dataframe_with_alignment_info>
        },
        ('PF07972', 2): {
            <another_dataframe_with_alignment_info>
        },
        ('PF03383', 1): {
            <yet_another_dataframe_with_alignment_info>
        },
    },
}
```

Each dataframe contains detailed alignment info for a given hit. In the above example, if we wanted
to assess alignment info about the hit of `PF00389.29` against the user gene with ID `3609`, we
would access the dataframe via `ali_info[3609][('PF00389', 1)]`. Since `PF00389` hit only once to
`3609`, the hit has the domain ID `1`. This entry in the nested dictionary is a dataframe that looks
like this:

I will refer to this as the *domain hits summary*. In this case, the IPfam `PF00389.29` hit to 2 user genes: `3609` and `5374`. Then, for each of these
genes, we can find further down in the file the alignment of each. For example, here is where the
alignment info for gene `3609` starts:

|    | seq   | hmm   | comparison   |   seq_positions |   hmm_positions |
|---:|:------|:------|:-------------|----------------:|----------------:|
|  0 | P     | E     | +            |              19 |               8 |
|  1 | E     | E     | E            |              20 |               9 |
|  2 | H     | E     |              |              21 |              10 |
|  3 | L     | L     | L            |              22 |              11 |
|  4 | T     | E     |              |              23 |              12 |
|  5 | R     | L     | +            |              24 |              13 |
|  6 | L     | L     | L            |              25 |              14 |
|  7 | E     | K     | +            |              26 |              15 |

This dataframe is a per-residue characterization of the alignment strings, i.e. the columns
`match_state_align`, `sequence_align`, and `comparison_align` found in `dom_hits.`. For convenience,
positions in the alignment that contain a gap either in the HMM or in the gene sequence are stripped
from this dataset. `seq_positions` correspond to the 0-indexed positions in the user gene--in this
example `3609`. In other words, these are the `codon_order_in_gene` values that aligned to a non-gap
position in the HMM. Why doesn't `seq_positions` start at 0? Because in this example, the hit starts
at the 20th amino acid in the user gene. Sanity check: this means the `ali_start` entry in the
corresponding row of `self.dom_hits` would be 20.

The mapping of sequence positions to HMM match states encapsulated in this dataframe is the
essential information required for attributing binding frequencies to user genes, since the binding
frequencies in the tab-separated InteracDome files are attributed to match states. Diagramatically,
the flow of information goes like:

```
                    [InteracDome]               [ali_info]
(binding frequency) ------------> (match state) ---------> (user gene residue)
```

Together, these 2 data structures are the fruits of labor from parsing the HMMER standard out and
provide generic utility that extends beyond just `anvi-run-interacdome`

## (5) Filtering HMM hits

### Pfam gathering threshold

As previously mentioned, `hmmsearch` is ran with the `--cut_ga` flag, which using Pfam gathering
thresholds to pre-filter a lot of poor-quality hits.

### Filtering partial hits

In the InteracDome paper, Kobren and Singh are more stringent about filtering hits than I decided to
be. In the paper, it is demanded that 100% of the Pfam HMM maps to the user gene, i.e. the first and
last position of the HMM hit should be non-gap characters, or else the hit is discarded. In other
words, they discarded all partial hits. I have opted to relax this constraint since it seemed too
strict for my applications, however, I did want to enforce some kind of threshold that would discard
hits that are *very* partial. To quantify the partialness of a hit I defined the *hit fraction*
quantity, which is defined as

$$ f = K/L $$

where \$K\$ is the alignment length (`hmm_stop` - `hmm_start`) and \$L\$ is the length of the HMM
profile (the number of match states). For example, in the hit below, PF01212 has length of \$293\$
(not shown below, but trust me), and the alignment length is \$169-33=136\$, so the hit fraction is
\$f = 136/293 \approx 0.46\$.

To apply a filter based on partialness, I created a threshold value, `self.min_hit_threshold`
(specified with `--min-hit-fraction`) that the hit fraction of a hit must exceed in order to be
kept. If `self.min_hit_threshold = 0.5`, then the above hit would be removed since its hit fraction
is \$\approx 0.46\$. To determine a reasonable default value for this threshold, I calculated the
hit fractions for all hits of an *E. faecalis* genome against the IPfams which yielded 2898 hits.
Here is the resulting histogram of hit fractions:

[![hit-fraction-hist]({{images}}/hit_fraction_histogram.png)]({{images}}/hit_fraction_histogram.png){:.center-img .width-90}

From this histogram, I deemed 0.8 was a good compromise between data retention and quality, so that
is the default on July 21st, 2020.

### Filtering bad hits

Really, filtering bad hits is what the Pfam gathering threshold is designed for. But to be extra
sure that we are not including junk, I followed the protocol of the InteracDome paper. To understand
what Kobren and Singh did, we must first make a one paragraph detour to define some terms.

An HMM profile is composed of match states, one for each residue position in the HMM profile. And
each match state is composed of 20 emission probabilities, one for each amino acid. An emission
probability gives a probability that a given amino acid is observed for the match state. So match
states which are highly conserved will have a single dominant emission probability, whereas an
unconserved match state will have more uniformly distributed emission probabilities, meaning many
amino acids can inhabit the match state. To quantify how conserved a match state is, there is a
quantity used in sequence logos called [information
content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_logo#Logo_creation), which compares the entropy of a
perfectly uniform distribution of emission probabilities to the observed entropy of emission
probabilities. The formula boils down to this:

$$ IC = \log_2{20} + \sum_{i=1}^{20}{ f_i \log_2{f_i} }$$

where \$f_i\$ is the emission probability of the \$i\$th amino acid. The equation's worth boils down
to this: the higher the information content, the more conserved the match state is.

With this in mind, Kobren and Singh noted each position in each HMM profile that had an information
content exceeding 4 (very conserved).
