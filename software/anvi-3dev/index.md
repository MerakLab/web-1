# Anvi-3dev: Integrating metagenomic sequence variants and predicted protein structures

Anvi-3dev is an analysis and visualization platform for visualizing single-amino acid and
single-codon variants derived from metagenomic/metatranscriptomic data onto predicted protein
structure. Its purpose is to enable microbial ecologists with the tools necessary to investigate
microbial diversity within the context of the structural properties of translated gene products,
thereby bridging a gap between microbial ecoogy and structural biology.

# Install

anvi-3dev is developed using the anvi'o framework. In fact, it is integrated directly into anvi'o,
which means installing anvi-3dev is installed by **[installing anvi'o](/install-anvio/)**.
