Welcome, and thank you for your interest!

The link to the registration form is at the end of this post. But we will assume that you have read everything on this page! :)

## Motivation

**The primary aim of this seminar series is to give a broad introduction to some of the key concepts and strategies that enable us to study the ecology, evolution, and functioning of naturally occurring microbial populations.**

The last several years witnessed tremendous advances in molecular and computational approaches which now offer unprecedented access to naturally occurring microbial communities through new *'omics* strategies. Developing an overall understanding of these strategies -including the ability to identify their appropriate applications and shortcomings- has quietly become a *de facto* necessity in the journey of an independent life scientist.

While most of these strategies are quite accessible thanks to the increasing number of computational tools and pipelines, without a complete understanding of the key concepts, exploiting available computational solutions to address unique scientific questions remain difficult. The purpose of the seminar series is to offer some introductions to key concepts, without talking about tools or their practical applications.

## Target audience

**The target audience of this seminar series is beginners from all backgrounds who are interested in microbial 'omics**.

Even if you have never been exposed to the strategies the seminars will cover, you will likely to be able to follow the content and discussions.

Seminars will use simple terms and simple language as much as possible.

## Seminar format

Each week there will be a seminar, and each seminar will be composed of two sections: lecture, and discussion.

### Lecture part

**Lectures** will take approximately an hour and will use slides for presentation.

### Discussion part

**Discussions** will take and additional 30 to 45 minutes and will be dedicated to **questions, exchange of ideas, and practical considerations**. Although the target audience is beginners, our sessions will undoubtedly include researchers who are experienced on the topic and will be encouraged to take part in discussions.

## Logistics

**If you are registered for a given week, you will get an e-mail 15 minutes before the start time with URLs that will enable you to follow the session.**

**We will primarily use Zoom for lectures**. If you plan to attend, please [download](https://zoom.us/download) the latest version of Zoom beforehand. If you already have Zoom installed on your computer, please make sure it is up to date. On the Zoom call, any participant will be able to unmute themselves to ask questions verbally, or use the chat window to do it in written form during the lecture or discussion sections. A person who will be identified at the beginning of each seminar will interrupt the speaker at appropriate times and brings up questions from the chat window.

**In parallel, we will also use YouTube to stream the content live**. Those who are registered for the seminar series will also be given a YouTube URL. This way, if there are more people than our Zoom account can accommodate, they will follow the seminar and discussions through YouTube.

{:.notice}
There will be a 20 to 40 second delay between Zoom and YouTube.


## Lecturers

* **[Meren](https://twitter.com/merenbey)**: Assistant Professor in the [Department of Medicine](https://medicine.uchicago.edu/) and the [Committee on Microbiology](https://biomedsciences.uchicago.edu/page/microbiology) at the **[University of Chicago](http://uchicago.edu)**, and a Fellow of the **[Marine Biological Laboratory](http://mbl.edu)**.

* **[Emily Fogarty](https://twitter.com/emily_fogarty11)**: Graduate Student in the **[Committee on Microbiology](https://biomedsciences.uchicago.edu/page/microbiology)** at the University of Chicago. *Emily will answer questions asked on the chat window during the YouTube live stream, or bring them up with the lecturer(s)*. 


## Schedule

**Every lecture will take place on a Wednesday at 9am Chicago Time (CST)** ([see what time it corresponds to in your city](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20200708T140000&p1=64&p2=259&p3=240&p4=514&p5=770&p6=676&p7=233&p8=246&p9=155&p10=250&p11=16&p12=176)).
