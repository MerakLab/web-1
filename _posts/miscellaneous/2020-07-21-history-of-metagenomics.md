This past quarter, I had the opportunity to dive into the history of metagenomics and how it has shaped our current understanding of microbial ecology and evolution. To report on my journey, I decided to write a blogpost, summarizing ideas in the field that have shaped the questions I am addressing in my own research today. The goal of my thesis work is to integrate environmental metagenomic data and genomics data to explore key insights into microbial fitness in environments such as the human gut and the oceans. My hope is that this blog post is approachable and accurate, and sets the state for why I am able to ask these exciting questions.

Best,
Matthew Schechter
