We make a lot of typos. Sometimes parameters change slightly across versions, and we often fail to keep tutorials up-to-date at all times. If you find a mistake on this page, or if you would like to change something within it, you can directly [edit its source code](https://github.com/merenlab/web/blob/master/_posts/{{ include.source }}) by clicking the _"Edit this file"_ icon at the top-right corner (which you will see if you have logged in to GitHub). We will be very thankful for your contribution ðŸ˜‡
