10.1016/j.celrep.2017.06.060	Antibiotics during pregnancy promote offspring gut dysbiosis, immune dysfunction, and IBD.; Antibiotics given after the developmental period do not increase IBD.; Antibiotic-perturbed maternal microbiota likely contribute to neonatal gut dysbiosis.; <a href="https://sciencelife.uchospitals.edu/2017/07/11/antibiotics-taken-late-in-pregnancy-can-increase-risk-for-inflammatory-bowel-diseases-in-offspring/" target="_blank">Press release</a>.	http://i.imgur.com/jvmaUfV.png
10.1101/129791	Novel nitrogen-fixing populations (see <a href="http://merenlab.org/data/#delmont-et-al-2017--tara-binning" target="_blank">public data</a>).; Nearly 1,000 non-redundant and high-quality bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic population genomes from TARA Oceans metagenomes.; Extensive description of <a href="http://merenlab.org/data/2017_Delmont_et_al_HBDs/" target="_blank">bioinformatics approaches</a>.	http://i.imgur.com/oFRefc4.jpg
10.7717/peerj.1319	The methods paper for <a href="http://merenlab.org/software/anvio/" target="_blank">anvi'o</a>.; Binning, and single-nucleotide variant analysis of a human gut time series metagenome.; Re-analysis of cultivar genomes, metagenomes, and metatranscriptomes associated with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.	http://i.imgur.com/d1c7bUY.png
10.1186/s40168-017-0270-x	An FMT study with metagenome-assembled genomes (see <a href="http://merenlab.org/data/#lee-et-al-2017--fecal-transplants" target="_blank">public data</a>).;Bacteroidales: high-colonization rate. Clostridiales: low colonization rate. Colonization success is negatively correlated with the number of genes related to sporulation.; MAGs with the same taxonomy showed different colonization properties, highlighting the importance of high-resolution analyses.; Populations colonized both recipients were also prevalent in the HMP cohort (and the ones that did not, distribute sporadically across the HMP cohort).	http://i.imgur.com/4e4Ic4u.jpg
10.3389/fmicb.2015.00358	 Application of <i>in situ</i> enrichments to shape the diversity of complex metagenomes prior to sequencing.; The first successful attempt to assemble multiple near-complete bacterial genomes directly from a soil sample.; The abundance of reconstructed genomes ranged from rare (<0.0001%) to relatively abundant (>0.01%) in pristine soil metagenomes.	../images/pubs/delmont_rare_soil_genomes.png
10.7717/peerj.1839	A holistic approach to visualize and curate genomic and metagenomic assemblies.;A re-analysis of the first released Tardigrade genome reveals a likely symbiont among other contaminants.; A practical approach to estimate the number bacterial genomes in an assembly.	../images/pubs/delmont_tardigrade.png
10.1101/170639	Using single-amino acid variants to investigate genome variation within a single SAR11 population across large geographies.; Application of a novel Deep Learning algorithm to resolve relationships between metagenomes through complex SAAV data.; Partitioning of SAAVs suggests natural selection, rather than neutral evolution, is the main driver of the evolution of SAR11.	http://i.imgur.com/HrlXPOF.jpg

10.7717/peerj.4320	A big-data study in which a pangenome of 31 <i>Prochlorococcus</i> isolates meets 31 billion Tara Oceans metagenomic sequences.; Metapangenomes reveal to what extent genes that may be linked to the ecology and fitness of microbes are conserved within a phylogenetic clade.; Reproducible bioinformatics workflow: <a href="http://merenlab.org/data/2018_Delmont_and_Eren_Metapangenomics/" target="_blank">http://merenlab.org/data/2018_Delmont_and_Eren_Metapangenomics/</a>	https://i.imgur.com/gzDpEU5.jpg
10.1186/s40168-018-0474-8	Two groups of genetically identical mice with different microbial community structures differ in their response to skin transplants from genetically identical sources: one group rejects the skin faster than the other.; Transferrin:xag poop from slow-rejecting mice into fast-rejecting mice turns fast-rejecting mice into slow-rejecting mice.; These suggest that differences in 'resident microbiome' in healthy individuals <i>may</i> contribute to interpersonal variability in graft outcomes, and fecal microbiota transplantation <i>may</i> play a therapeutic role to reverse that phenotype.; Basically, "we do not have a mechanistic understanding, but this is definitely very interesting".
