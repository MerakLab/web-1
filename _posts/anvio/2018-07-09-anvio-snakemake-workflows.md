[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a robust language to create computational workflows. We recently have started using it extensivley with our anvi'o workflows, which provided us with better reproducibility and documentation of our work.

In order to let you enjoy anvi'o together with the wonders of snakemake, we embarked on an effort to make some of the commonly used anvi'o workflows more accessible and easy-to-use (well, not *too* easy .. after all this is 'science').

The purpose of this post is to describe and demonstrate, through mock datasets, the main use cases of these anvi'o workflows. We will begin with a general introduction, and continue with examples of each workflow. As you go through the tutorial, you will have a chance to download the mock data package, and repeat all the steps described here to reproduce the results, or repurpose it for your own tasks.

# A general introduction to essentials

From raw reads or individual genomes to read recruitment analyses and pangenomes, 'omics workflows can be composed of many interdependent steps and can quicky get complex with increasing number of samples. The purpose of anvi'o workflows is to help you,

1. **Streamline repetative and, in most cases, rather standard initial steps of 'omics data analyses** (such as assembly, mapping, profiling of mapping results, functional/taxonomic annotation, creating anvi'o databases, etc) in a scalable form,

2. **Quickly** get you to a point where you can start asking your novel questions to your data,

3. Get you there in a way that is **reproducible, scalable, and easy to describe** to your peers.

Anvi'o workflows rely on [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and gives you the option to make these workflows more specific through config files.

{:.notice}
If you don't wish to dig into the documentation of snakemake right now, that's fine. The only essential piece of information you may want ot keep in mind is that each *step* of the analysis (for example running `anvi-gen-contigs-database`) corresponds to a "rule" in the snakemake workflow.

Anvi'o allows you to use its workflows through the program `anvi-run-workflow` (see the help menu [here]({{site.url}}/software/anvio/vignette/#anvi-run-workflow)). For a given workflow this program helps you prepare a **config file**, about which we will promptly learn in the next chapter, and then run it.

You can ask the program to see what workflows it knows about:

```
$ anvi-run-workflow --list-workflows
Available workflows ....: contigs, metagenomics, pangenomics
```

You should consult with your own installation to see what workflows available to you in case we failed to keep this page up-to-date.

While anvi'o workflows provide a standard canvas for basic operations, you fill this canvas by telling anvi'o where to find files, what parameters to use while working on them, and where to store output files. Following sections in this chapter describe some of those essential files that are commonly used in one or more workflows.

## config.json

Once you know which worklfow you want to work with, the config file gives you a great degree of flexibility to modify parameters and order of steps associated with that workflow. The config file is a mandatory input of all workflows, even if you are fine with all default parameters. You should always take a look at the config file since you should not escape from the complexity of anything that will impact your findings. Preparing a config file from scratch for a given workflow could be quite a streneous task. But do not worry, we got you covered:

```
anvi-run-workflow -w WORKFLOW-NAME \
                  --get-default-config OUTPUT-FILE-NAME
```

For a given workflow, the flag `--get-default-config` will give you a default config file so you can edit it. This file will contain all configurable flags and parameters. You can simply keep any parameter that you don't plan to change 'as is', or you can remove those you are not interested in changing from your config file to make your config file shorter and cleaner.

The config file contains configurations of three types:

1. **General workflow parameters**: A name for your project, which *mode* of the workflow to use (we will talk more about this later).

2. **Rule specific parameters**: Parameters that are only relevant to a given *rule*, such as minimum contig length parameter for the anvi'o profiling step. We tried as much as possible to allow the user to change any parameter that is configurable in the underlying software that are used in the workflow.

3. **Output directory names**: The way anvi'o will organize output files and directories. A fixed output directory structure has been very helpful for us for project independent access to results via *ad hoc* scripts.

<div class="extra-info" markdown="1">

<span class="extra-info-header">A note regarding rule specific parameters</span>

Rules in workflows are atomic operations that involve a single program. Such as assembling short reads using `IDBA_UD`, or profiling a BAM file using `anvi-profile`. Each of the programs used in a workflow comes with their unique paramters, which creates a problem regarding how to 'expose' them to the user for editing.

To make things consistent, we decided that the way that parameters appear in the config file
would be identical to their name in the corresponding program. If there are multiple ways to use an argument,
then we chose the longer one. For instance, `anvi-run-hmms` will accept either `-H` or `--hmm-profile-dir` parameters to specify the HMM profile directory path. But in our rule for this step we only allow you to use `--hmm-profile-dir` in the config file.

But don't worry, if you use the wrong name, there will be a helpful message to let you know what are the correct arguments you can use for a given rule.
</div>

So this is the general introduction to the config file. In the next chapter you will find example config files for each one of the workflows.

## samples.txt

`samples.txt` file is the file that groups samples (if necessary), and links sample names to raw sequencing reads. There are supposed to be three or four columns (with the optional `groups` column) in a given `samples.txt` file where each column separated from each other with a TAB character. The header should contain the following column names:

* **sample**: A name that you chose to give to each one of your metagenomic samples.

* **group**: Often, when we want to bin genomes from metagenomic assemblies we wish to do so by co-assembling multiple samples (see for example [Albertsen et al. 2012](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2579) or [this blog post that explains how we binned the TARA Oceans metagenomes](http://merenlab.org/data/2017_Delmont_et_al_HBDs/)). The purpose of this column is to define which samples are going to be co-assembled together. This is an optional column, if this column is not included in the `samples_txt` file, then each sample will be assembled separately. By default, only the samples that were used for the co-assembly would then be mapped to the resulting assembly. If you want, you can co-assemble groups of samples, but then map **all** samples to each assembly (see the [all_against_all](#all-against-all-mode) option for the config file).

* **r1**, and **r2**: These two columns hold the path (could be either a relative or an absolute path, it is always better to have absolute paths) to the FASTQ files that correspond to the sample. 

<div class="extra-info" markdown="1">

<span class="extra-info-header">Merging pair-end fastq files</span>

If multiple pair-end reads fastq files correspond to the same samlpe, they could be listed separated by a comma (with no space). This could be relevant, for example, if one sample was sequenced in multiple runs. Let's take a `samples_txt` with three samples, but assume that `sample_01` was sequenced twice. The `samples_txt` file would then look like this (notice the second line of the file):

```
sample     group  r1                                             r2
sample_01  G01    sample-01-R1a.fastq.gz,sample-01-R1b.fastq.gz  sample-01-R2a.fastq.gz,sample-01-R2b.fastq.gz
sample_02  G02    sample-02-R1.fastq.gz                          sample-02-R2.fastq.gz
sample_03  G02    sample-03-R1.fastq.gz                          sample-03-R2.fastq.gz
```

{:.notice}
If your fastq files are already quality filtered, and you didn't do it with this workflow, and you wish to skip the quality filtering step, **AND** for some reason you didn't already merge the fastq files that should be merged together, then you must do so manually, and then provide only one `r1` file and one `r2` file per sample. 

</div>

To see how this file is used, you can primarily take a look at the metagenomics workflow in the later chapters in this document.

## fasta.txt

`fasta.txt` file is a file that holds a name and a path to fasta files that are needed as input for a workflow. You can see an example of how these are used in the [contigs workflow](#contigs-workflow), [pangenomics workflow](#pangenomics-workflow), or the [reference mode](#references-mode) of the metagenomics workflow. Here is an example file:

```bash
name	path
A_NAME_YOU_CHOSE	/absolute/path/fasta_01.fa
ANOTHER_NAME	relative/path/fasta_02.fa
```

# Mock Data

This part is totally optional, and you can skip it if you do not wish to run the example commands throughout this tutorial on your computer using the mock data we prepared for you. But if you do, here is how you can setup the mock data directory on your computer:

```bash
# download the data pack
wget http://merenlab.org/files/WORKFLOW_TUTORIAL_DATA.tar.gz

# unpack it
tar -xvzf WORKFLOW_TUTORIAL_DATA.tar.gz

# go into the directory
cd WORKFLOW_TUTORIAL_DATA

# uncompress the mock contigs FASTA files
gzip -d three_samples_example/*contigs*.gz
```

Now you can follow the steps in this tutorial and run everything on your machine (assuming you have anvi'o and other programs are installed).

{:.warning}
Examples throughout this tutorial will use simpler forms of `anvi-run-workflow` commands for the sake of clarity, which will result in processes that can run on a single computer with a single thread. It is almost never a good idea (unless you know what you are doing), and you should keep an eye on relevant notes and sections in this document that clarify how to work with clusters, and tailor your additional parameters based on your system's requirements for real-world applications. Do you think you are lost? Please get in touch with your system administrator, they will know what to do it. Are you the system administrator and feeling lost? Please get in touch with us through anvi'o [Slack](https://anvio.slack.com/) or [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/anvio)!


# Workflows

In this section we will go through current anvi'o workflows, and demonstrate how they work.

{:.notice}
Anvi'o workflows rely on inheritance, which means a workflow can be invoked from within another one.

## Contigs workflow

{:.warning}
This workflow is useful if you have one or more **FASTA files** that describe one or more contigs for your assembled metagenomes or genomes, and you want to get anvi'o contigs databases.

The contigs workflow is meant for cases in which all you want is to create anvi'o contigs databases from FASTA files, and annotate them with functions, taxonomy, etc. Since the design of workflows allow inheritcance, contigs workflow will be used by other workflows we will describe later.

You could simply ask anvi'o to give you a default config file for contigs workflow, 

```bash
anvi-run-workflow -w contigs \
                  --get-default-config config-contigs-default.json
```

and you could examine its content to find out all possible options to tweak. We included a much simpler config file, `config-contigs.json`, in the mock data package for the sake of demonstrating how the contigs workflow works:

```json
{
    "fasta_txt": "fasta.txt",
    "output_dirs": {
        "FASTA_DIR":   "01_FASTA_contigs_workflow",
        "CONTIGS_DIR": "02_CONTIGS_contigs_workflow",
        "LOGS_DIR":    "00_LOGS_contigs_workflow"
    }
}
```

This file basically says "use the FASTA files described in fasta.txt file, and do what you have to do". Before running anything, you should take a look at the steps that will be ran the way snakeameke sees them. You can ask anvi'o to ask snakemake to generate a workflow graph for you given your config file and input files:

```bash
anvi-run-workflow -w contigs \
                  -c config-contigs.json \
                  --save-workflow-graph
```

Which should result in this file, if you have everything else properly setup on your computer:

[![DAG-contigs]({{images}}/DAG-contigs.png)]( {{images}}/DAG-contigs.png){:.center-img .width-50}

{:.notice}
Generating the workflow graph requires the usage of [dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)).
If you are using MAC OSX, you can use [dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) by installing [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) through `brew` or `conda`.

{:.notice}
Please take a look at the file `fasta.txt` in your mock data directory to better understand why things look like this.

Fine. Now we could run this workflow the following way:

```bash
anvi-run-workflow -w contigs \
                  -c config-contigs.json
```

If everything goes smoothly, you should see happy messages flowing on your screen, and at the end of it all you should see your contigs databases are generated and annotated properly. To see whether things really worked as expected, we can run

```
anvi-display-contigs-stats 02_CONTIGS_contigs_workflow/G01-contigs.db
```

Which should give us this:

[![display-contigs]({{images}}/display-contigs.png)]( {{images}}/display-contigs.png){:.center-img .width-50}

Good? Good!

You just ran your first anvi'o workflow successfully.

<div class="extra-info" markdown="1">

<span class="extra-info-header">Working on cluster systems</span>

Before we continue any further, let's talk about one of the most amazing aspects of snakemake. The abovementioned `anvi-run-workflow` command was ran on the computer on which it was executed, using a single core. But as you know, a large fraction of 'omics analyses are too big to run in single threads and without distributing to multiple computers on a cluster. Fortunately, the developers of snakemake made it possible to seamlessly distribute a job on a cluster with a defined amount of resources for parallelization. In order to understand how to utilize this, below you can find the details on [how to run the anvio workflows on a cluster](#running-workflows-on-a-cluster).

</div>


## Metagenomics workflow

The majority of the steps used in this workflow are extensively described in the [anvi'o user tutorial for metagenomic workflow](http://merenlab.org/2016/06/22/anvio-tutorial-v2/), however, in contrast to that tuturial, which begins with the FASTA files of contigs and BAM files, this workflow includes steps *to get there*, including quality filtering of raw reads, assembling them into contigs, and mapping short reads steps.

**The default entering point** to the metagenomics workflow is the raw paired-end sequencing reads for one or more shotgun metagenomes. **The default end point** of the workflow is an anvi'o merged profile database ready for refinement of bins (or whatever it is that you want to do with it), along with an annotated anvi'o contigs database. While these are the default entry and end points, there are many more ways to use the metagenomic workflow that we will demonstrate later.

The workflow includes the following steps:

1. Quality control of metagenomic short reads using [illumina-utils](https://github.com/merenlab/illumina-utils/), and generating a comprehesnive final report for the results of this step (so you have your Supplementary Table 1 ready).

2. Individual or combined assembly of quality filtered metagenomic reads using either [megahit](https://github.com/voutcn/megahit) or [idba_ud](https://github.com/loneknightpy/idba).

3. Generating an anvi'o contigs database from assembled contigs using [anvi-gen-contigs-database](http://merenlab.org/2016/06/22/anvio-tutorial-v2/#anvi-gen-contigs-database). This part of the metagenomics workflow inherits from the contigs workflow, so you know this step also includes the annotation of your contigs database(s) with functions, HMMs, and taxonomy.

4. Mapping short reads from each metagenome to the contigs using [bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml), and generate sorted and indexed BAM files.

5. Profiling individual BAM files using [anvi-profile](http://merenlab.org/2016/06/22/anvio-tutorial-v2/#anvi-profile) to generate single anvi'o profiles.

6. Merging resulting single anvi'o profiles using [anvi-merge](http://merenlab.org/2016/06/22/anvio-tutorial-v2/#anvi-merge).


The metagenomic worfklow is quite talented and can be ran in multiple 'modes'. The fullowing sections will detail different use cases.


### Default mode

As mentioned above, the standard usage of this workflow is meant to go through all the steps from raw reads to having a merged profile database (or databases) ready for binning.

All you need is a bunch of FASTQ files, and a `samples.txt` file. Here, we will go through a mock example with three small metagenomes. These metagenomes were made by choosing a small number of reads from three [HMP](https://www.hmpdacc.org/) metagenomes (these reads were not chosen randomly, for more details, [ask Alon](mailto:alon.shaiber@gmail.com)). In your working directory you have the following `samples.txt` file:

```bash
$ column -t samples.txt
sample     group  r1                                           r2
sample_01  G01    three_samples_example/sample-01-R1.fastq.gz  three_samples_example/sample-01-R2.fastq.gz
sample_02  G02    three_samples_example/sample-02-R1.fastq.gz  three_samples_example/sample-02-R2.fastq.gz
sample_03  G02    three_samples_example/sample-03-R1.fastq.gz  three_samples_example/sample-03-R2.fastq.gz
```

As previous chapters clarified, this is the file that describes our 'groups' and locations of raw paired-end reads for each sample. The default name for your `samples_txt` file is `samples.txt`, but you can use a different name by specifying it in the config file (see below).

In your working directory there is a config file `config-idba_ud.json`, let's take a look at it.

```
{
    "samples_txt": "samples.txt",
    "idba_ud": {
        "--min_contig": 1000,
        "threads": 11,
        "run": true
    }
}
```

Very short. Every configurable parameter (and there are many many of them) that is not mentioned here will be assigned a default value. 

{:.notice}
We usually like to start with a default config file, and then delete every line for which we wish to keep the default (if you don't delete it, then nothing would happen, but why keep garbage in your files?).

So what do we have in the example config file above?

* **samples_txt**: Path for our `samples.txt` (since we used the default name `samples.txt` then we didn't really have to include this in the config file).

* **idba_ud**: A few parameters for `idba_ud`. 

  -	**run**: Currently two assembly software are available in the workflow: megahit and idba_ud. We didn't set neither of these as the default software, and hence if you wish to assemble things then you must set the `run` parameter to `true` for one (and only one) of these. 
	
  - **--min-contig**: From the help menu of `idba_ud` [we learn]({{images}}/idba_ud_min_contig.png) that `idab_ud` has the default as `200`, and we want it as `1,000`, and hence we include this in the config.

  - **threads**: When you wish to use multi-threads you can specify how many threads to use for each step of the workflow using this parameter. Here we chose 11 threads for `idba_ud`.

<div class="extra-info" markdown="1">

<span class="extra-info-header">A note on rule specific parameters</span>
We suggest that you take a minute to look at the default config file. To do so, run:

```bash
anvi-run-workflow -w metagenomics \
                  --get-default-config default-metagenomics-config.json
```

It is very big, and that's why we didn't paste it here. We keep things flexible for you, and that means having many parameters.

But there are some general things you can notice:

 - **threads** - every rule has the parameter "threads" available to it. This is meant for the case in which you are using multi-threads to run things. To learn more about how snakemake utilizes threads you can refer to the snakemake documentation. We decided to allow to set the number of threads for all rules, including ones that we ourselves never use more than 1 (why? because, why not? maybe someone would one day need it for some reason. Don't judge). When **threads** is the only parameter that is available for a rule, it means that there is nothing else that you can configure for this rule. Specifically, it means you don't even get to choose whether this rule is ran or not. But don't worry, snakemake would make sure that steps that are not necessary will not run.
 
 - **run** - some rules have this parameter. The rules that have this parameter are optional rules. To make sure that an optional rule is ran you need to set the `run` parameter to `true`. If you wish not to run an optional rule, then you must set `run` to `false` or simply an empty string (`""`). Some of the optional rules run by default and others don't. You can find out what is the default behaviour by looking at the default config file. As mentioned above, if a rule doesn't have the **run** parameter it means that snakemake will infer whether it needs to run or not (just have some trust please!).

 - **parameters with an empty value (`""`)** - Many of the parameters in the default config file get an empty value. This means that the default parameter that is provided by the underlying program will be used. For example, the rule `anvi_gen_contigs_database` is responsible for running `anvi-gen-contigs-database` (we tried giving intuitive names for rules :-)). Below you can see all the available configurations for `anvi_gen_contigs_database`. Let's take the parameter `--split-length` as an example. By refering to the help menu of `anvi-gen-contigs-database` you will find that the default for `--split-length` is 20,000, and this default value will be used by `anvi-gen-contigs-database` if nothing was supplied in the config file.
You may notice another interesting thing, which is that the value for `--project-name` is `"{group}"`. This is a little magic trick to make it so that the project name in your contigs database would be indentical to the group name that you supplied in the config file. If you wish to understand this syntax, you may read about [the snakemake wildcards](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html#wildcards).

```
    "anvi_gen_contigs_database": {
        "--project-name": "{group}",
        "threads": 5,
        "--description": "",
        "--skip-gene-calling": "",
        "--external-gene-calls": "",
        "--ignore-internal-stop-codons": "",
        "--skip-mindful-splitting": "",
        "--contigs-fasta": "",
        "--split-length": "",
        "--kmer-size": ""
    },
```

</div>


Ok, so now we have everything we need to start, let's first run a sanity check and create a workflow graph for our workflow:

```
anvi-run-workflow -w metagenomics \
                  -c config-idba_ud.json \
                  --save-workflow-graph
```

A file named `workflow.png` was created and should look like this:

[![idba_ud_workflow1]({{images}}/idba_ud_workflow1.png)]( {{images}}/idba_ud_workflow1.png){:.center-img .width-50}

Take a minute to take a look at this image to understand what is going on. From a first look it might seem complicated, but it is fairly straight forward (and also, shouldn't you know what is going on with your data?!?).

Ok, let's run this.

<div class="extra-info" markdown="1">

<span class="extra-info-header">Using "screen" to run stuff</span>

We always start our work by initiating a [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html) session. If you are not familiar with what this is, basically, we use it here because we are running something that requires no user interaction for a long time on a remote machine (e.g. a cluster head node).

```
screen -S mysnakemakeworkflow
```

After the workflow is running you simply click **ctrl-A** followd by **D** to detach from the screen. If you want to check the status of your workflow, then to reconnect to your screen use:

```
screen -r mysnakemakeworkflow
```

And when you want to kill it use **ctrl-D** (while connected to the screen).

At any given time you can see a list of all your screens this way:

```
screen -ls
```

Simple, but extremely efficient.

</div>

Now we can run the workflow:

```
anvi-run-workflow -w metagenomics \
                  -c config-idba_ud.json
```

Once everything finishes running (on our cluster it only takes 6 minutes as these are very small mock metagenomes), we can take a look at one of the merged profile databases:

```
anvi-interactive -p 06_MERGED/G02/PROFILE.db \
                 -c 03_CONTIGS/G02-contigs.db
```

And it should look like this:

[![merged_profile_idba_ud1]({{images}}/merged_profile_idba_ud1.png)]( {{images}}/merged_profile_idba_ud1.png){:.center-img .width-50}

Ok, so this looks like a standard merged profile database with two samples. As a bonus, we also added a step to import the number of short reads in each sample ("Total num reads"), and we also used it to calculate the percent of reads from the sample that have been mapped to the contigs ("Percent Mapped").

If you remember, we had two "groups" in the samples.txt file. Hence, we have two contigs databases and two merged profile databases. Let's take a look at the other profile database, but since this group only included one sample, then there was nothing to merge. What we do in this case, is that we automatically add the `--cluster-contigs` argument to `anvi-profile` (see the the help menu: `anvi-profile -h` for more details). We still create a "fake" merged profile database here: `06_MERGED/G01/PROFILE.db`, but this is just a mock output file, if you look into it you'll see:

```
$ cat 06_MERGED/G01/PROFILE.db
Only one file was profiled with G01 so there is nothing to
merge. But don't worry, you can still use anvi-interactive with
the single profile database that is here: 05_ANVIO_PROFILE/G01/sample_01/PROFILE.db
```


```bash
anvi-interactive -p 05_ANVIO_PROFILE/G01/sample_01/PROFILE.db \
                 -c 03_CONTIGS/G01-contigs.db
```

Don't like these names? You can specify what is the name of the folder, by providing the following information in the config file:

```
    "output_dirs": {
        "LOGS_DIR"    : "00_MY_beAuTiFul_LOGS",
        "QC_DIR"      : "BEST_QC_DIR_EVER",
        "ASSEMBLY_DIR": "assemblies",
        "CONTIGS_DIR" : "/absolute/path/to/my/contigs/dir",
        "MAPPING_DIR" : "relative/path/to/my/mapping/dir",
        "PROFILE_DIR" : "/I/already/did/my/profiling/and/this/is/where/you/can/find/it/",
        "MERGE_DIR".  : "06_Keep_Calm_and_Merge_On"
    }
```

You can change all, or just some of the names of these output folders. And you can provide an absolute or a relative path for them.
</div>

In addition to the merged profile databases and the contigs databases (and all intermediate files), the workflow has another output, the QC report, which you can find here: `01_QC/qc-report.txt`. Let's look at it:

| sample    | number of pairs analyzed | total pairs passed | total pairs passed (percent of all pairs) | total pair_1 trimmed | total pair_1 trimmed (percent of all passed pairs) | total pair_2 trimmed | total pair_2 trimmed (percent of all passed pairs) | total pairs failed | total pairs failed (percent of all pairs) | pairs failed due to pair_1 | pairs failed due to pair_1 (percent of all failed pairs) | pairs failed due to pair_2 | pairs failed due to pair_2 (percent of all failed pairs) | pairs failed due to both | pairs failed due to both (percent of all failed pairs) | FAILED_REASON_P | FAILED_REASON_P (percent of all failed pairs) | FAILED_REASON_N | FAILED_REASON_N (percent of all failed pairs) | FAILED_REASON_C33 | FAILED_REASON_C33 (percent of all failed pairs) |

### All against all mode

The default behaviour for this workflow is to create a contigs database for each _group_ and map (and profile, and merge) the samples that belong to that _group_. If you wish to map all samples to all contigs, use the `all_against_all` option in the config file:

```
    "all_against_all": true
```

In your working directory you can find an updated config file `config-idba_ud-all-against-all.json`, that looks like this:

```json
{
    "samples_txt": "samples.txt",
    "idba_ud": {
        "--min_contig": 1000,
        "threads": 11,
        "run": true
    },
    "all_against_all": true
}
```

And we can generate a new workflow graph:

```bash
anvi-run-workflow -w metagenomics \
                  -c config-idba_ud-all-against-all.json \
                  --save-workflow-graph
```

An updated DAG for the workflow for our mock data is available below:

[![idba_ud-all-against-all]({{images}}/idba_ud-all-against-all.png)]( {{images}}/idba_ud-all-against-all.png){:.center-img .width-50}

A little more of a mess! But also has a beauty to it :-).

<div class="extra-info" markdown="1">

<span class="extra-info-header">A short advertisement for snakemake</span>
If you are new to **snakemake**, you might be surprised to see how easy it is to switch between modes. All we need to do is tell the **anvi_merge** rule that we want all samples merged for each _group_, and snakemake immediatly infers that it needs to also run the extra mapping, and profiling steps. *Thank you snakemake!* (says everyone).
</div>

### References Mode

{:.warning}
This mode is used when you have one or more genomes, and one or more metagenomes from which you wish to recruit reads using your genomes.

Along with assembly-based metagenomics, we often use anvi'o to explore the occurence of population genomes accross metagenomes. A good example of how useful this approach could be is described in this blogpost: [DWH O. desum v2: Most abundant Oceanospirillaceae population in the Deepwater Horizon Oil Plume](http://merenlab.org/2017/11/25/DWH-O-desum-v2/).
For this mode, what you have is a bunch of fastq files (metagenomes) and fasta files (reference genomes), and all you need to do is to let the workflow know where to find these files, using two `.txt` files: `samples_txt`, and `fasta_txt`. 

`fasta_txt` should be a 2 column tab-separated file, where the first column specifies a reference name and the second column specifies the filepath of the fasta file for that reference.

After properly formatting your `samples_txt` and `fasta_txt`, reference mode is initiated by adding these to your config file:

```
"fasta_txt": "fasta.txt",
"references_mode": true
```

The `samples_txt` stays as before, but this time the `group` column will specify for each sample, which reference should be used (aka the name of the reference as defined in the first column of `fasta_txt`). If the `samples_txt` file doesn't have a `group` column, then an ["all against all"](#all-against-all-mode) mode would be provoked. 

First let's set up the reference fasta files:

```bash
gunzip three_samples_example/*.fa.gz
```

in your directory you can find the following `fasta.txt`, and `config-references-mode.json`:

```bash
$ cat fasta.txt
name       path
G01     three_samples_example/G01-contigs.fa
G02     three_samples_example/G02-contigs.fa

$ cat config-references-mode.json
{
    "fasta_txt": "fasta.txt",
    "references_mode": true,
    "output_dirs": {
        "FASTA_DIR": "02_FASTA_references_mode",
        "CONTIGS_DIR": "03_CONTIGS_references_mode",
        "QC_DIR": "01_QC_references_mode",
        "MAPPING_DIR": "04_MAPPING_references_mode",
        "PROFILE_DIR": "05_ANVIO_PROFILE_references_mode",
        "MERGE_DIR": "06_MERGED_references_mode",
        "LOGS_DIR": "00_LOGS_references_mode"
    }
}
```

Let's create a workflow graph:

[![dag-references-mode]({{images}}/dag-references-mode.png)]( {{images}}/dag-references-mode.png){:.center-img .width-50}


<div class="extra-info" markdown="1">

<span class="extra-info-header">A note from Alon on why we need the references_mode flag</span>
This is a note that is mainly directed at anvi'o developers, so feel free to skip this note.

We could have just invoked "references_mode" if the user supplied a `fasta_txt`, but I decided to have a specific flag for it, to make things more verbose for the user.
</div>

Now we can run this workflow:

```bash
anvi-run-workflow -w metagenomics \
                  -c config-references-mode.json
```

## Pangenomics workflow

Running a [pangenomic workflow](http://merenlab.org/2016/11/08/pangenomics-v2/) with anvio is really easy. But now it is even easier. And the beauty of this workflow is that it would inherently include all the steps to annotate your contigs databases with what you wish (functions, hmms, taxonomy, etc.).

### With external genomes

All you need are a bunch of fasta files, and a `fasta_txt`, formatted in the same manner that is described [above in references mode](#references-mode). In your working dir you can find the config `config-pangenomics.json`:

```
{
    "project_name": "MYPAN",
    "anvi_gen_genomes_storage": {
        "--external-genomes": "my-external-genomes.txt"
    },
    "fasta_txt": "fasta.txt",
    "output_dirs": {
        "FASTA_DIR": "01_FASTA_contigs_workflow",
        "CONTIGS_DIR": "02_CONTIGS_contigs_workflow",
        "LOGS_DIR": "00_LOGS_pan_workflow"
    }
}
```

Notice that you must give a name to the external genomes file (including a relative or absolute path). This file doesn't have to exist, it will be created for you during the workflow. We named it above: `my-external-genomes.txt`.

We can create a workflow graph:

```
anvi-run-workflow -w pangenomics \
                  -c config-pangenomics.json \
                  --save-workflow-graph
```

[![DAG-pangenomics]({{images}}/DAG-pangenomics.png)]( {{images}}/DAG-pangenomics.png){:.center-img .width-50}

Since we used the same directories from the [contigs workflow above](#contigs-workflow), then some of the steps don't have to be repeated. These steps are inside dashed lines in the workflow graph, whereas the rules that will be executed are inside a box. If we gave the `CONTIGS_DIR` a new name then these steps would be repeated and new contigs databases would be created and annotated.

Now we can run it:

```
anvi-run-workflow -w pangenomics \
                  -c config-pangenomics.json
```

This takes two minutes to run, and then we can take a look:

```
anvi-display-pan -g 03_PAN/MYPAN-GENOMES.db \
                 -p 03_PAN/MYPAN-PAN.db
```

[![PAN-external]({{images}}/PAN-external.png)]( {{images}}/PAN-external.png){:.center-img .width-50}

### With internal genomes

We will use the profile databases that we created earlier to run this example. If you haven't gone through the metagenomics part of this tutorial you have to go back there and run the steps descreibed in the [standard usage](#standard-usage) section.

After we have profile databases ready, we create collections. In this mock example we will just create default collections using `anvi-script-add-default-collection`:

```bash
anvi-script-add-default-collection -p 05_ANVIO_PROFILE/G01/sample_01/PROFILE.db \
                                   -c 03_CONTIGS/G01-contigs.db

anvi-script-add-default-collection -p 06_MERGED/G02/PROFILE.db \
                                   -c 03_CONTIGS/G02-contigs.db
```

In your working directory you have a config file `config-pangenomics-internal-genomes.json`:

```json
{
    "project_name": "MYPAN-INTERNAL",
    "anvi_gen_genomes_storage": {
        "--internal-genomes": "my-internal-genomes.txt"
    },
    "output_dirs": {
        "FASTA_DIR": "01_FASTA_contigs_workflow",
        "CONTIGS_DIR": "02_CONTIGS_contigs_workflow",
        "LOGS_DIR": "00_LOGS_pan_internal_workflow",
        "PAN_DIR": "03_PAN_INTERNAL_GENOMES"
    }
}
```

You can also find in your working directory a file called `my-internal-genomes.txt`, it looks like this:

| name | bin_id     | collection_id | profile_db_path                           | contigs_db_path           |
|------|------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| s1   | EVERYTHING | DEFAULT       | 05_ANVIO_PROFILE/G01/sample_01/PROFILE.db | 03_CONTIGS/G01-contigs.db |
| s2   | EVERYTHING | DEFAULT       | 06_MERGED/G02/PROFILE.db                  | 03_CONTIGS/G02-contigs.db |

We create a workflow graph:

```bash
anvi-run-workflow -w pangenomics \
                  -c config-pangenomics-internal-genomes.json \
                  --save-workflow-graph
```

This time it is much much simpler (only two steps!):


[![DAG-internal-genomes]({{images}}/DAG-internal-genomes.png)]( {{images}}/DAG-internal-genomes.png){:.center-img .width-50}

And we run it:

```bash
anvi-run-workflow -w pangenomics \
                  -c config-pangenomics-internal-genomes.json
```

[![PAN-internal]({{images}}/PAN-internal.png)]( {{images}}/PAN-internal.png){:.center-img .width-50}

## With external AND internal genomes

We can use the files from the examples above. In your working directory you will find the following config file, `config-pangenomics-internal-external.json`:

```json
{
    "project_name": "MYPAN_COMBINED",
    "anvi_gen_genomes_storage": {
        "--external-genomes": "my-external-genomes.txt",
        "--internal-genomes": "my-internal-genomes.txt"
    },
    "fasta_txt": "fasta.txt",
    "output_dirs": {
        "FASTA_DIR": "01_FASTA_contigs_workflow",
        "CONTIGS_DIR": "02_CONTIGS_contigs_workflow",
        "LOGS_DIR": "00_LOGS_pan_combined_workflow",
        "PAN_DIR": "03_PAN_INTERNAL_EXTERNAL_GENOMES"
    }
}
```

Let's generate a workflow graph:

```bash
anvi-run-workflow -w pangenomics
                  -c config-pangenomics-internal-external.json
                  --save-workflow-graph
```

[![DAG-internal-external-pan]({{images}}/DAG-internal-external-pan.png)]( {{images}}/DAG-internal-external-pan.png){:.center-img .width-50}

Notice that most steps are in dashed boxes since we are using results from previuous runs.

And now we run it:

```bash
anvi-run-workflow -w pangenomics \
                  -c config-pangenomics-internal-external.json
```

And finally, we display it:

```bash
anvi-display-pan -g 03_PAN_INTERNAL_EXTERNAL_GENOMES/MYPAN_COMBINED-GENOMES.db
                 -p 03_PAN_INTERNAL_EXTERNAL_GENOMES/MYPAN_COMBINED-PAN.db
```

# Running workflows on a cluster

When submitting to a cluster, you can utilize the [snakemake cluster execution](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executable.html#cluster-execution). Notice that the number of threads per rule could be changed using the `config.json` file (and not by using the [cluster configuration](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executable.html#cluster-execution) file).

The `{log}` and `{threads}` arguments are part of the snakemake syntax, and you can learn more about them from the snakemake documentation as well. Briefly, `{threads}` is a wildcard that for each job submitted to the cluster will be replaced by the number of threads that you supplied in the config file for the specific rule (or the default number of threads that we set for that rule). Similarly, `{log}` is a wildcard that will be replaced by the name of the log file that we set for each rule, unless you decided to change it, the log files would appear in your working directory under the directory `00_LOGS`.

When submitting a workflow to a cluster, snakemake requires you to limit the number of jobs that will be submitted in parallel by using the argument `--jobs`. If you prefer to limit the number of threads that would be used by your workflow (for example, if you share your cluster with others and you don't want to consume all resources), then you can make use of the snakemake built-in `resources` directive. You can set the number of jobs to your limit (or to a very big number if you don't care), and use `--resources nodes=30`, if you wish to only use 30 threads. We used the word `nodes` so that to not confuse with the reserved word `threads` in snakemake.

For instance, if you were working with our servers, the command to run the contigs workflow, described above under the [Contigs workflow section of the turtorial](#contigs-workflow), would look like this:

```bash
anvi-run-workflow -w contigs \
                  -c config-contigs.json \
                  --additional-params \
                      --cluster 'clusterize -log {log} -n {threads}' \
                      --jobs 20 \
                      --resources nodes=40
```

The main difference from the first command is the parameter list described under `--additional-params`. Without these, this command would be ran on a single computer, but with these additions, it would utilze a server system and limit itself to 40 nodes while not keeping more than 20 jobs in the queue.

**This will not run on your cluster system**, because on our cluster, we use a wrapper for `qsub`, which we call `clusterize` in order to submit jobs to our cluster. If you are not sure how to submit jobs to your cluster, ask your system admin. Please consult with the [snakemake docummentation](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html#threads) to learn more about the `--cluster` parameter.

Notice: if you don't include `--jobs` (identical to `--cores`) in your command line, then snakemake will only use one node, and will not utilize multiple nodes even if the `threads` parameter for a rule is higher than 1. This is simply the behaviour of snakemake (described [here](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html#threads)).

<div class="extra-info" markdown="1">

<span class="extra-info-header">A note on cluster-config</span>

This note is here mainly for documentation of the code, and for those of you who are interested in snakemake. The reason we decided not to use the [cluster configuration](http://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executable.html#cluster-execution) file to control the number of threads per rule, is becuase certain software require the number of threads as an input (for example `megahit` and `anvi-profile`), but the cluster config file is not available for shell commands within snakemake rules. To bypass this issue we simply put the threads configuration in the `config.json`, thus available for the user to modify.

</div>

# The ADDITIONAL PARAMS option


To use the `--cluster` argument of snakemake above, we used the `--additional-params` option of `anvi-run-workflow`, let's understand it better. The purpose of `--additional-params` is to allow you to access any configuration that is available through snakemake (i.e. anything that is listed when you look at the help menu of snakemake through `snakemake -h` is fair game as an input for `--additional-params`). For example you can do the following,

``` bash
anvi-run-workflow -w metagenomics \
                  -c config-idba_ud.json \
                  --additional-params \
                      --notemp \
                      --ignore-incomplete
```

... to use snakemake's `--notemp` and `--ignore-incomplete` options (you can read about these in the snakemake help menu to understand what they do). Notice that `--additional-params` has to be the last thing that is passed to `anvi-run-workflow` in the command line, and only followed by  arguments of snakemake (i.e. arguments that are listed in the help menu of snakemake). The purpose here is to not limit any of the configuration that snakemake allows the user.

When using the `--additional-params`, a message with red letters will be printed. This message is just there to make sure that you are using this parameter correctly (i.e. putting it at the end of the command).

# FAQ

Our aim here is to collect commonly needed functionalities from anvi'o workflows. If you need something, send your question to us and we will do our best to add the solution down below.

## Is it possible to just do QC and then stop?

If you only want to qc your files and then compress them (and not do anything else), simply invoke the workflow with the following command:

```
anvi-run-workflow -w metagenomics \
                  -c config.json \
                  --additional-params \
                      --until gzip_fastqs
```

## Can I skip anvi-script-reformat-fasta?

Yes! In "reference mode", you may choose to skip this step, and keep your original contigs names by changing the `anvi_script_reformat_fasta` rule the following way:

```
	"anvi_script_reformat_fasta": {
		"run": false
	}
```

In assembly mode, this rule is always excecuted.

## What's going on behind the scenes before we run idba_ud?

A note regarding `idba_ud` is that it requires a single fasta as an input. Because of that, what we do is use `fq2fa` to merge the pair of reads of each sample to one fasta, and then we use `cat` to concatenate multiple samples for a co-assembly. The `fasta` file that is created is create as a temporary file, and is deleted once `idba_ud` finishes running. If this is annoying to you, then feel free to contact us or just hack it yourself.

## Can I change the parameters of samtools view?

The samtools command executed is:

```
samtools view additional_params -bS INPUT -o OUTPUT
```

Where `additional_params` refers to any parameters of samtools view that you choose to use (excluding `-bS` or `-o` which are always set by the workflow).For example, you could set it to be `-f 2`, or `-f 2 -q 1` (for a full list see the samtools [documentation](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html)). The default value for `additional_params` is `-F 4`.

## Can I change the parameters for Bowtie2?

Similar to [samtools](#can-i-change-the-parameters-of-samtools-view) we use the `additional_params` to configure Bowtie2. The bowtie rule executes the following command:

```
bowtie2 --threads NUM_THREADS \
        -x PREFIX_OF_BOWTIE_BUILD_OUTPUT \
        -1 R1.FASTQ \
        -2 R2.FASTQ \
        additional_params \
        -S OUTPUT.sam
```

Hence, you can use `additional_params` to specify all parameters except `--threads`, `-x`, `-1`, `-2`, or `-S`.

For example, if you don't want gapped alignment (aka the reference does not recruit any reads that contain indels with respect to it), and you don't want to store unmapped reads in the SAM output file, set `additional_params` to be `--rfg 10000,10000 --no-unal` (for a full list of options see the bowtie2 [documentation](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml#options)). The default is `--no-unal`.

## How can I restart a failed job?
If your job fails for some reason you can use  `additional_params` with the original command to restart the workflow where it stopped. For example:

```
anvi-run-workflow -w metagenomics \
                  -c config-idba_ud.json \
		  --additional-params \
		  --keep-going --rerun-incomplete
```
Here using `additional_params` with the `--keep-going` and `--rerun-incomplete` flags will resume the job even if it failed in the middle of a rule, like `anvi_profile`. Of course it is always a good idea to figure out why a workflow failed in the first place.

{:.notice}
When a workflow fails, then you would need to unlock the working directory before rerunning. This means you would have to run the full command with the `--unlock` flag once, and then run the command again without the `--unlock` flag. Please refer to the snakemake docummentation for [more details regarding how snakemake locks the working directory](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/project_info/faq.html#how-does-snakemake-lock-the-working-directory).

## I skipped importing "percent reads mapped" to my progiles, is there an easy way to recover this?

I'm glad you asked! All you need to do is to force the workflow to execute the step of importing this information to each single profile database, and then repeat the merging step. To do so, update your config so that it includes:

```json
    "import_percent_of_reads_mapped": {
        "run": true
    },
```

Then, delete your merged profile database, and then run the workflow again. You should probably start with a sanity check first, just to see that snakemake understands that it only needs to run the `import_percent_of_reads_mapped` step and the `anvi_merge` step.
