## Description

{:.notice}
**No one has described this artifact yet** :/ If you would like to contribute by describing it, please see previous examples [here](https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/tree/master/anvio/docs/artifacts), and add a Markdown formatted file in that directory named "internal-genomes.md". Its contents will replace this sad text. THANK YOU!
