This program helps you extract synteny patterns from a group of similar loci or genomes. This is accomplished by deconstructing contigs into Ngrams (group of neighboring genes of which N is the number of genes) using a sliding window method. Once completed, anvi&#39;o will export a table with Ngrams for you to work with. If more than one annotation source is provided, please designate which annotation_source anvio should use to make the Ngrams with using the --ngram-source parameter (e.g. gene_clusters, COG_FUNCTION). By default anvi&#39;o will ignore Ngrams that contain genes without annotations. If you would like to override this, you can use the --analyze-unknown-functions flag.
