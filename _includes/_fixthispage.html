We make a lot of typos. Sometimes parameters slightly change across versions, and we often fail to keep tutorials up-to-date at all times. If you found a mistake on this page, or if you would like to change something in it, you can directly [edit its source code](https://github.com/merenlab/web/blob/master/_posts/{{ include.source }}) by clicking _"Edit this file"_ icon on the right top corner (which you will see if you have logged in to GitHub), and send us a 'pull request'. We will be very thankful for your contribution ðŸ˜‡
