# Programs

Please let us know if there is something unclear in this output.


## anvi-cluster-with-concoct

A program to cluster items in a merged anvi&#39;o profile using CONCOCT, and
optionally creating a collection in the profile database. This is especially
useful if you need to have more control over the number of clusters to work
with if you are planning to refine them manually later.

`profile_db` `clustering` `collections` 


**Example uses and other resources**


* [Original CONCOCT paper by Alneberg et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3103)

* [An example usage of the program in the context of the Infant Gut Dataset by Sharon et al.](http://merenlab.org/tutorials/infant-gut/#from-fragmentation-to-conflation-error-a-meren-lab-heuristic-to-fight-back)

* [The use of this program in the context of initial binning of TARA population genomes](http://merenlab.org/data/2017_Delmont_et_al_HBDs/#initial-automated-binning-with-concoct)



**Usage**

```
anvi-cluster-with-concoct [-h] -p PROFILE_DB -c CONTIGS_DB
                          [-o FILE_PATH] [--skip-store-in-db]
                          [-C COLLECTION_NAME]
                          [--num-clusters-requested INT]
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -p PROFILE_DB, --profile-db PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o profile database
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
  -o FILE_PATH, --output-file FILE_PATH
                        File path to store results.
  --skip-store-in-db    By default, analysis results are stored in the profile
                        database. The use of this flag will let you skip that
  -C COLLECTION_NAME, --collection-name COLLECTION_NAME
                        Collection name.
  --num-clusters-requested INT
                        How many clusters do you request? Default is 400.
```





## anvi-compute-ani

Export sequences from external genomes and compute ANI. If Pan Database is
given anvi&#39;o will write computed output to misc data tables of Pan Database.





**Usage**

```
anvi-compute-ani [-h] [-i FILE_PATH] [-e FILE_PATH] -o DIR_PATH
                 [-p PAN_DB]
                 [--min-alignment-fraction MIN_ALIGNMENT_FRACTION]
                 [--significant-alignment-length SIGNIFICANT_ALIGNMENT_LENGTH]
                 [--method {ANIm,ANIb,ANIblastall,TETRA}]
                 [--distance DISTANCE_METRIC]
                 [--linkage LINKAGE_METHOD] [-T NUM_THREADS]
                 [--just-do-it] [--log-file FILE_PATH]
```

**Parameters**



**INPUT OPTIONS:**   Tell anvi&#39;o what you want.

```
  -i FILE_PATH, --internal-genomes FILE_PATH
                        A five-column TAB-delimited flat text file. The header
                        line must contain thse columns: 'name', 'bin_id',
                        'collection_id', 'profile_db_path', 'contigs_db_path'.
                        Each line should list a single entry, where 'name' can
                        be any name to describe the anvi'o bin identified as
                        'bin_id' that is stored in a collection.
  -e FILE_PATH, --external-genomes FILE_PATH
                        A two-column TAB-delimited flat text file that lists
                        anvi'o contigs databases. The first item in the header
                        line should read 'name', and the second should read
                        'contigs_db_path'. Each line in the file should
                        describe a single entry, where the first column is the
                        name of the genome (or MAG), and the second column is
                        the anvi'o contigs database generated for this genome.
```



**OUTPUT OPTIONS:**   Tell anvi&#39;o where to store your results.

```
  -o DIR_PATH, --output-dir DIR_PATH
                        Directory path for output files
  -p PAN_DB, --pan-db PAN_DB
                        This is totally ooptional, but very useful when
                        applicable. If you are running ANI for genomes for
                        which you already have an anvi'o pangeome, then you
                        can show where the pan database is and anvi'o would
                        automatically add the results into the misc data
                        tables of your pangenome. Those data can then be shown
                        as ANI heatmaps on the pan interactive interface
                        through the 'layers' tab.
```



**FILTERING HITS:**   These filters can save lives. Ask Luke.

```
  --min-alignment-fraction MIN_ALIGNMENT_FRACTION
                        In some cases you may get high raw ANI estimates
                        between two genomes that have nothing to do with each
                        other simply because only a small fraction of their
                        content may be aligned. This filter will eliminate ANI
                        scores between two genomes if the alignment fraction
                        is less than you deem trustable. When you set a value,
                        anvi'o will go through the ANI results, and set
                        percent identity scores between two genomes to 0 if
                        the alignment fraction *between either of them* is
                        less than the parameter described here. The default is
                        0.0, so every hit is reported, but you can go rebel,
                        and choose any value between 0.0 and 1.0.
  --significant-alignment-length SIGNIFICANT_ALIGNMENT_LENGTH
                        So --min-alignmnet-fraction discards any hit that is
                        coming from alignments that represent shorter
                        fractions of genomes, but what if you still don't want
                        to miss an alignment that is longer than an X number
                        of nucleotides regardless of what fraction of the
                        genome it represents? Well, this parameter is to
                        recover things that may be lost due to --min-
                        alignment-fraction parameter. Let's say, if you set
                        --min-alignment-fraction to '0.05', and this parameter
                        to '5000', anvi'o will keep hits from alignments that
                        are longer than 5000 nts, EVEN IF THEY REPRESENT less
                        than 5% of a given genome pair. Basically if --min-
                        alignment-fraction is your shield to protect yourself
                        from incoming garbage, --significant-alignment-length
                        is your chopstick to pick out those that may be
                        interesting, and you are a true warrior here.
```



**pyANI METHOD:**   Tell anvi&#39;o to tell pyANI what method you wish to use.

```
  --method {ANIm,ANIb,ANIblastall,TETRA}
                        Method for pyANI. The default is ANIb. You must have
                        the necessary binary in path for whichever method you
                        choose. According to the pyANI help for v0.2.7 at
                        https://github.com/widdowquinn/pyani, the method
                        'ANIm' uses MUMmer (NUCmer) to align the input
                        sequences. 'ANIb' uses BLASTN+ to align 1020nt
                        fragments of the input sequences. 'ANIblastall': uses
                        the legacy BLASTN to align 1020nt fragments Finally,
                        'TETRA': calculates tetranucleotide frequencies of
                        each input sequence
```



**HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING:**   Once pyANI is done with its magic, it reports ANI between genomes as
  distance matrix files, which can be clustered into nice looking
  dendrograms to display the relationships between genomes nicely (in the
  anvi&#39;o interface and elsewhere). Here you can set the distance metric and
  the linkage algorithm for that.

```
  --distance DISTANCE_METRIC
                        The distance metric for the hierarchical clustering.
                        The default is "euclidean".
  --linkage LINKAGE_METHOD
                        The linkage method for the hierarchical clustering.
                        The default is "ward".
```



**OTHER IMPORTANT STUFF:**   Yes. You&#39;re almost done.

```
  -T NUM_THREADS, --num-threads NUM_THREADS
                        Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading
                        whenever possible. Very conservatively, the default is
                        1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number of CPUs
                        / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with
                        this option if you are running your commands on a SGE
                        --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking for
                        multiple threads to use, you may deplete your
                        resources very fast.
  --just-do-it          Don't bother me with questions or warnings, just do
                        it.
  --log-file FILE_PATH  File path to store debug/output messages.
```

## anvi-compute-gene-cluster-homogeneity

Compute homogeneity for gene clusters





**Usage**

```
anvi-compute-gene-cluster-homogeneity [-h] -p PAN_DB
                                      [-g GENOMES_STORAGE]
                                      [-o FILE_PATH] [--store-in-db]
                                      [--gene-cluster-id GENE_CLUSTER_ID]
                                      [--gene-cluster-ids-file FILE_PATH]
                                      [-C COLLECTION_NAME]
                                      [-b BIN_NAME]
                                      [--quick-homogeneity]
                                      [-T NUM_THREADS] [--just-do-it]
```

**Parameters**



**INPUT FILES:**   Input files from the pangenome analysis.

```
  -p PAN_DB, --pan-db PAN_DB
                        Anvi'o pan database
  -g GENOMES_STORAGE, --genomes-storage GENOMES_STORAGE
                        Anvi'o genomes storage file
```



**REPORTING:**   How do you want results to be reported? Anvi&#39;o can produce a TAB-delimited
  output file for you (for which you would have to provide an output file
  name). Or the results can be stored in the pan database directly, for
  which you would have to explicitly ask for it. You can get both as well in
  case you are a fan of redundancy and poor data analysis practices. Anvi&#39;o
  does not judge.

```
  -o FILE_PATH, --output-file FILE_PATH
                        File path to store results.
  --store-in-db         Store analysis results into the database directly.
```



**SELECTION:**   Which gene clusters should be analyzed. You can ask for a single gene
  cluster, or multiple ones listed in a file, or you can use a collection
  and bin name to list gene clusters of interest.

```
  --gene-cluster-id GENE_CLUSTER_ID
                        Gene cluster ID you are interested in.
  --gene-cluster-ids-file FILE_PATH
                        Text file for gene clusters (each line should contain
                        be a unique gene cluster id).
  -C COLLECTION_NAME, --collection-name COLLECTION_NAME
                        Collection name.
  -b BIN_NAME, --bin-id BIN_NAME
                        Bin name you are interested in.
```



**OPTIONAL:**   Optional stuff available for you to use

```
  --quick-homogeneity   By default, anvi'o will use a homogeneity algorithm
                        that checks for horizontal and vertical geometric
                        homogeneity (along with functional). With this flag,
                        you can tell anvi'o to skip horizontal geometric
                        homogeneity calculations. It will be less accurate but
                        quicker.
  -T NUM_THREADS, --num-threads NUM_THREADS
                        Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading
                        whenever possible. Very conservatively, the default is
                        1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number of CPUs
                        / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with
                        this option if you are running your commands on a SGE
                        --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking for
                        multiple threads to use, you may deplete your
                        resources very fast.

                        database in appropriate contexts).
  -t NAME, --target-data-table NAME
                        The target table is the table you are interested in
                        accessing. Currently it can be 'items','layers', or
                        'layer_orders'. Please see most up-to-date online

                        database. If you do not use this parameter, anvi'o
                        will simply remove everything from the target data
                        table immediately.
  --list-available-keys
                        Using this flag will list available data keys in the
                        target data table and quit without doing anything
                        else.

                           [-I IP_ADDR] [-P INT] [--browser-path PATH]
                           [--server-only] [--password-protected]
                           CONTIG DATABASES) [CONTIG DATABASE(S ...]
```

**Parameters**



**positional arguments:** 

```
  CONTIG DATABASE(S)    Anvio'o Contig databases to display statistics, you
                        can give multiple databases by seperating them with
                        space.
```



**REPORT CONFIGURATION:**   Specify what kind of output you want.

```
  --report-as-text      If you give this flag, Anvi'o will not open new
                        browser to show Contigs database statistics and write
                        all stats to TAB separated file and you should also
                        give --output-file with this flag otherwise Anvi'o
                        will complain.
  -o FILE_PATH, --output-file FILE_PATH
                        File path to store results.
```



**SERVER CONFIGURATION:**   For power users.

```
  -I IP_ADDR, --ip-address IP_ADDR
                        IP address for the HTTP server. The default ip address
                        (0.0.0.0) should work just fine for most.
  -P INT, --port-number INT
                        Port number to use for anvi'o services. If nothing is
                        declared, anvi'o will try to find a suitable port
                        number, starting from the default port number, 8080.
  --browser-path PATH   By default, anvi'o will use your default browser to
                        launch the interactive interface. If you would like to
                        use something else than your system default, you can
                        provide a full path for an alternative browser using
                        this parameter, and hope for the best. For instance we
                        are using this parameter to call Google's experimental
                        browser, Canary, which performs better with demanding
                        visualizations.
  --server-only         The default behavior is to start the local server, and
                        fire up a browser that connects to the server. If you
                        have other plans, and want to start the server without
                        calling the browser, this is the flag you need.
  --password-protected  If this flag is set, command line tool will ask you to
                        enter a password and interactive interface will be
                        only accessible after entering same password. This
                        option is recommended for shared machines like
                        clusters or shared networks where computers are not
                        isolated.
```





## anvi-display-pan

Start an anvi&#39;o server to display a pan-genome





**Usage**

```
anvi-display-pan [-h] -p PAN_DB [-g GENOMES_STORAGE] [-d VIEW_DATA]
                 [-t NEWICK] [-V ADDITIONAL_VIEW]
                 [-A ADDITIONAL_LAYERS] [--view NAME] [--title NAME]
                 [--state-autoload NAME] [--collection-autoload NAME]
                 [--export-svg FILE_PATH] [--skip-init-functions]
                 [--dry-run] [--skip-auto-ordering] [-I IP_ADDR]
                 [-P INT] [--browser-path PATH] [--read-only]
                 [--server-only] [--password-protected]
```

**Parameters**



**INPUT FILES:**   Input files from the pangenome analysis.

```
  -p PAN_DB, --pan-db PAN_DB
                        Anvi'o pan database
  -g GENOMES_STORAGE, --genomes-storage GENOMES_STORAGE
                        Anvi'o genomes storage file
```



**OPTIONAL INPUTS:**   Where the yay factor becomes a reality.

```
  -d VIEW_DATA, --view-data VIEW_DATA
                        A TAB-delimited file for view data
  -t NEWICK, --tree NEWICK
                        NEWICK formatted tree structure
```



**ADDITIONAL STUFF:**   Parameters to provide additional layers, views, or layer data.

```
  -V ADDITIONAL_VIEW, --additional-view ADDITIONAL_VIEW
                        A TAB-delimited file for an additional view to be used
                        in the interface. This file file should contain all
                        split names, and values for each of them in all
                        samples. Each column in this file must correspond to a
                        sample name. Content of this file will be called
                        'user_view', which will be available as a new item in
                        the 'views' combo box in the interface
  -A ADDITIONAL_LAYERS, --additional-layers ADDITIONAL_LAYERS
                        A TAB-delimited file for additional layers for splits.
                        The first column of this file must be split names, and
                        the remaining columns should be unique attributes. The
                        file does not need to contain all split names, or
                        values for each split in every column. Anvi'o will try
                        to deal with missing data nicely. Each column in this
                        file will be visualized as a new layer in the tree.
```



**VISUALS RELATED:**   Parameters that give access to various adjustements regarding the
  interface.

```
  --view NAME           Start the interface with a pre-selected view. To see a
                        list of available views, use --show-views flag.
  --title NAME          Title for the interface. If you are working with a
                        RUNINFO dict, the title will be determined based on
                        information stored in that file. Regardless, you can
                        override that value using this parameter. If you are
                        not using a anvio RUNINFO dictionary, a meaningful
                        title will appear in the interface only if you define
                        one using this parameter.
  --state-autoload NAME
                        Automatically load previous saved state and draw tree.
                        To see a list of available states, use --show-states
                        flag.
  --collection-autoload NAME
                        Automatically load a collection and draw tree. To see
                        a list of available collections, use --list-
                        collections flag.
  --export-svg FILE_PATH
                        The SVG output file path.
```



**SWEET PARAMS OF CONVENIENCE:**   Parameters and flags that are not quite essential (but nice to have).

```
  --skip-init-functions
                        When declared, function calls for genes will not be
                        initialized (therefore will be missing from all
                        relevant interfaces or output files). The use of this
                        flag may reduce the memory fingerprint and processing
                        time for large datasets.
  --dry-run             Don't do anything real. Test everything, and stop
                        right before wherever the developer said 'well, this
                        is enough testing', and decided to print out results.
  --skip-auto-ordering  When declared, the attempt to include automatically
                        generated orders of items based on additional data is
                        skipped. In case those buggers cause issues with your
                        data, and you still want to see your stuff and deal
                        with the other issue maybe later.
```



**SERVER CONFIGURATION:**   For power users.

```
  -I IP_ADDR, --ip-address IP_ADDR
                        IP address for the HTTP server. The default ip address

                        declared, anvi'o will try to find a suitable port

                        provide a full path for an alternative browser using
                        this parameter, and hope for the best. For instance we
                        are using this parameter to call Google's experimental
                        browser, Canary, which performs better with demanding
                        visualizations.
  --read-only           When the interactive interface is started with this
                        flag, all 'database write' operations will be
                        disabled.
  --server-only         The default behavior is to start the local server, and
                        fire up a browser that connects to the server. If you
                        have other plans, and want to start the server without

## anvi-display-structure

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit





**Usage**

```
anvi-display-structure [-h] -s STRUCTURE_DB [-p PROFILE_DB]
                       [-c CONTIGS_DB] [-V VARIABILITY_TABLE]

                       [--password-protected]
```

**Parameters**



**STRUCTURE:**   Information related to the structure database, which can be created with
  anvi-gen-structure-database.

```
  -s STRUCTURE_DB, --structure-db STRUCTURE_DB
                        Anvi'o structure database.
```



**VARIABILITY:**   We can overlay codon and amino acid variability in your metagenomes but we
  need a data source of this variability. Most simply, anvi&#39;o can learn this
  information when you provide both your profile (-p) and contigs (-c)
  databases. Alternatively, you can provide a variability table output (-V)
  from the program anvi-gen-variability-profile. Finally, you can visualize
  the structures without overlaying variation by providing the flag --no-
  variability.

```
  -p PROFILE_DB, --profile-db PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o profile database
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
  -V VARIABILITY_TABLE, --variability-profile VARIABILITY_TABLE
                        FIXME
```



**REFINING PARAMETERS:**   Which samples, genes, and contigs etc. are you interested in? Define that
  stuff here.

```
  --splits-of-interest FILE
                        A file with split names. There should be only one
                        column in the file, and each line should correspond to
                        a unique split name.
  -C COLLECTION_NAME, --collection-name COLLECTION_NAME
                        Collection name.
  -b BIN_NAME, --bin-id BIN_NAME
                        If provided, any genes found in both your bin and your
                        structure database will be available for display.
  --samples-of-interest FILE
                        A file with samples names. There should be only one
                        column in the file, and each line should correspond to
                        a unique sample name (without a column header).
  --genes-of-interest FILE
                        A file with anvi'o gene caller IDs. There should be
                        only one column in the file, and each line should
                        correspond to a unique gene caller id (without a
                        column header).
  --gene-caller-ids GENE_CALLER_IDS
                        Gene caller ids. Multiple of them can be declared
                        separated by a delimiter (the default is a comma). In
                        anvi-gen-variability-profile, if you declare nothing
                        you will get all genes matching your other filtering
                        criteria. In other programs, you may get everything,
                        nothing, or an error. It really depends on the
                        situation. Fortunately mistakes are cheap, so it's
                        worth a try.
  -j FLOAT, --min-departure-from-consensus FLOAT
                        Takes a value between 0 and 1, where 1 is maximum
                        divergence from the consensus. it can be an expensive
                        operation to display every variable position, and so
                        the default is 0.05. To display every variable
                        position, set this parameter to 0
  --SAAVs-only          If provided, variability will be generated for single
                        amino acid variants (SAAVs) and not for single codon
                        variants (SCVs). This could save you some time if
                        you're only interested in SAAVs.
  --SCVs-only           If provided, variability will be generated for single
                        codon variants (SCVs) and not for single amino acid
                        variants (SAAVs). This could save you some time if
                        you're only interested in SCVs.
```



**SERVER CONFIGURATION:**   For power users.

```
  -I IP_ADDR, --ip-address IP_ADDR
                        IP address for the HTTP server. The default ip address
                        (0.0.0.0) should work just fine for most.
  -P INT, --port-number INT
                        Port number to use for anvi'o services. If nothing is
                        declared, anvi'o will try to find a suitable port
                        number, starting from the default port number, 8080.
  --browser-path PATH   By default, anvi'o will use your default browser to
                        launch the interactive interface. If you would like to
                        use something else than your system default, you can
                        provide a full path for an alternative browser using
                        this parameter, and hope for the best. For instance we
                        are using this parameter to call Google's experimental
                        browser, Canary, which performs better with demanding
                        visualizations.
  --server-only         The default behavior is to start the local server, and
                        fire up a browser that connects to the server. If you
                        have other plans, and want to start the server without
                        calling the browser, this is the flag you need.
  --password-protected  If this flag is set, command line tool will ask you to
                        enter a password and interactive interface will be
                        only accessible after entering same password. This
                        option is recommended for shared machines like
                        clusters or shared networks where computers are not
                        isolated.

```

**Parameters**



**positional arguments:** 

```
  PATH                  Config file for clustering of contigs. See
                        documentation for help.
```



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -p PROFILE_DB, --profile-db PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o profile database
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-

                        Input directory where the input files addressed from
                        the configuration file can be found (i.e., the profile
                        database, if PROFILE.db::TABLE notation is used in the
                        configuration file).
  -N NAME, --name NAME  The name to use when storing the resulting clustering
                        in the database. This name will appear in the
                        interactive interface and other relevant interfaces.
                        Please consider using a short and descriptive single-
                        word (if you do not do that you will make anvi'o
                        complain).
  --distance DISTANCE_METRIC
                        The distance metric for the hierarchical clustering.
                        If you do not use this flag, the distance metric you
                        defined in your clustering config file will be used.
                        If you have not defined one in your config file, then
                        the system default will be used, which is "euclidean".
  --linkage LINKAGE_METHOD
                        Same story with the `--distance`, except, the system
                        default for this one is ward.
  --skip-store-in-db    By default, analysis results are stored in the profile
                        database. The use of this flag will let you skip that
  -o FILE_PATH, --output-file FILE_PATH
                        File path to store results.
  --dry-run             Don't do anything real. Test everything, and stop
                        right before wherever the developer said 'well, this
                        is enough testing', and decided to print out results.

## anvi-export-collection

Export a collection from an anvi&#39;o database





**Usage**

                        file type extensions please; just a prefix).
  --list-collections    Show available collections and exit.
  --include-unbinned    When this flag is used, anvi'o will also store in the
                        output file the items that do not appear in any of
                        your bins. This new bin will be called
                        'UNBINNED_ITEMS_BIN'. Yes. The ugly name is
                        intentional.

                        Get functional annotations for a specific list of
                        annotation sources. You can specifiy one or more
                        sources by separating them from each other with a
                        comma character (i.e., '--annotation-sources
                        source_1,source_2,source_3'). The default behavior is

```





## anvi-export-locus

This program helps you cut a &#39;locus&#39; from a larger context. Anvi&#39;o does this
by starting from one gene, and extending its selection based on how many genes
you want from its upstream or downstream in the contig its found. The first
gene anvi&#39;o focuses on is defined by you: you can either use a function name
in any of the functional annotation databases or default or user-defined HMMs,
or use a gene callers ID. If everything goes alright, you will get a separate
contigs database for every matching gene anvi&#39;o found in your master contigs
database. Enjoy your mini contigs databases.





**Usage**

```
anvi-export-locus [-h] -c CONTIGS_DB -n NUM_GENES [-s SEARCH_TERM]
                  [--gene-caller-ids GENE_CALLER_IDS]
                  [--delimiter CHAR] [-o DIR_PATH] -O FILENAME_PREFIX
                  [--separate-fasta] [--use-hmm]
                  [--hmm-sources SOURCE NAME] [-l] [-W]
                  [--remove-partial-hits] [--never-reverse-complement]
```

**Parameters**



**Essential INPUT:** 

```
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
  -n NUM_GENES, --num-genes NUM_GENES
                        For each match (to the function, or HMM that was
                        searched) a sequence which includes a block of genes
                        will be saved. The block could include either genes
                        only in the forward direction of the gene (defined
                        according to the direction of transcription of the
                        gene) or reverse or both. If you wish to get both
                        direction use a comma (no spaces) to define the block
                        For example, "-n 4,5" will give you four genes before
                        and five genes after. Whereas, "-n 5" will give you
                        five genes after (in addition to the gene that
                        matched). To get only genes preceeding the match use
                        "-n 5,0". If the number of genes requested exceeds the
                        length of the contig, then the output will include the
                        sequence until the end of the contig.
```



**Additional essential INPUT - OPTION 1:**   Search according to either HMM or functional annotations

```
  -s SEARCH_TERM, --search-term SEARCH_TERM
                        Search term.
```



**Additional essential INPUT - OPTION 2:**   Search specific gene id&#39;s

```
  --gene-caller-ids GENE_CALLER_IDS
                        Gene caller ids. Multiple of them can be declared
                        separated by a delimiter (the default is a comma). In
                        anvi-gen-variability-profile, if you declare nothing
                        you will get all genes matching your other filtering
                        criteria. In other programs, you may get everything,
                        nothing, or an error. It really depends on the
                        situation. Fortunately mistakes are cheap, so it's
                        worth a try.
  --delimiter CHAR      The delimiter to parse multiple input terms. The
                        default is ','.
```



**THE OUTPUT:**   Where should the output go. It will be one FASTA file with all matches or
  one FASTA per match (see --separate-fasta)

```
  -o DIR_PATH, --output-dir DIR_PATH
                        Directory path for output files
  -O FILENAME_PREFIX, --output-file-prefix FILENAME_PREFIX
                        A prefix to be used while naming the output files (no
                        file type extensions please; just a prefix).
```



**ADDITIONAL STUFF:**   Flags and parameters you can set according to your need

```
  --separate-fasta      Split each match to a separate FASTA file.
  --use-hmm             Use HMM hits instead of functional annotations. If you
                        choose this option, you must also say which HMM source
                        to use.
  --hmm-sources SOURCE NAME
                        Get sequences for a specific list of HMM sources. You
                        can list one or more sources by separating them from
                        each other with a comma character (i.e., '--hmm-
                        sources source_1,source_2,source_3'). If you would
                        like to see a list of available sources in the contigs
                        database, run this program with '--list-hmm-sources'
                        flag.
  -l, --list-hmm-sources
                        List available HMM sources in the contigs database and
                        quit.
  -W, --overwrite-output-destinations
                        Overwrite if the output files and/or directories
                        exist.
  --remove-partial-hits
                        By default anvi'o will return hits even if they are
                        partial. Declaring this flag will make anvi'o filter
                        all hits that are partial. Partial hits are hits in
                        which you asked for n1 genes before and n2 genes after
                        the gene that matched the search criteria but the
                        search hits the end of the contig before finding the
                        number of genes that you asked.
  --never-reverse-complement
                        By default, if a gene that is found by the search
                        criteria is reverse in it's direction, then the
                        sequence of the entire locus is reversed before it is
                        saved to the output. If you wish to prevent this
                        behavior then use the flag --never-reverse-complement.
```





## anvi-export-misc-data

Export additional data or order tables in pan or profile databases for items
or layers.





**Usage**

```
anvi-export-misc-data [-h] -p PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB -t NAME [-D NAME]
                      [-o FILE_PATH]
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -p PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB, --pan-or-profile-db PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o pan or profile database (and even genes
                        database in appropriate contexts).
  -t NAME, --target-data-table NAME
                        The target table is the table you are interested in
                        accessing. Currently it can be 'items','layers', or
                        'layer_orders'. Please see most up-to-date online
                        documentation for more information.
  -D NAME, --target-data-group NAME
                        Data group to focus. Anvi'o misc data tables support
                        associating a set of data keys with a data group. If
                        you have no idea what this is, then probably you don't
                        need it, and anvi'o will take care of you. Note: this
                        flag is IRRELEVANT if you are working with additioanl
                        order data tables.
  -o FILE_PATH, --output-file FILE_PATH

## anvi-export-splits-and-coverages

Export sequences and mean coverages across samples for splits or contigs





**Usage**

```
anvi-export-splits-and-coverages [-h] -p PROFILE_DB -c CONTIGS_DB
                                 [-o DIR_PATH] [-O FILENAME_PREFIX]
                                 [--splits-mode] [--report-contigs]
                                 [--use-Q2Q3-coverages]
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -p PROFILE_DB, --profile-db PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o profile database
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
  -o DIR_PATH, --output-dir DIR_PATH
                        Directory path for output files
  -O FILENAME_PREFIX, --output-file-prefix FILENAME_PREFIX
                        A prefix to be used while naming the output files (no
                        file type extensions please; just a prefix).
  --splits-mode         Specify this flag if you would like to output
                        coverages of individual 'splits', rather than their
                        'parent' contig coverages.
  --report-contigs      By default this program reports sequences and their
                        coverages for 'splits'. By using this flag, you can
                        report contig sequences and coverages instead. For
                        obvious reasons, you can't use this flag with
                        `--splits-mode` flag.
  --use-Q2Q3-coverages  By default this program reports the mean coverage of a
                        split (or contig, see --report-contigs) for each
                        sample. By using this flag, you can report the mean
                        Q2Q3 coverage by excluding 25 percent of the
                        nucleotide positions with the smallest coverage
                        values, and 25 percent of the nucleotide positions
                        with the largest coverage values. The hope is that
                        this removes 'outlier' positions resulting from non-
                        specific mapping, etc. that skew the mean coverage
                        estimate.

                          [--skip-mindful-splitting]
```

**Parameters**



**MANDATORY INPUTS:**   Things you really need to provide to be in business.

```
  -f FASTA, --contigs-fasta FASTA
                        The FASTA file that contains reference sequences you
                        mapped your samples against. This could be a reference
                        genome, or contigs from your assembler. Contig names
                        in this file must match to those in other input files.
                        If there is a problem anvi'o will gracefully complain
                        about it.
  -n PROJECT_NAME, --project-name PROJECT_NAME
                        Name of the project. Please choose a short but
                        descriptive name (so anvi'o can use it whenever she
                        needs to name an output file, or add a new table in a
                        database, or name her first born).
```



**OPTIONAL INPUTS:**   Things you may want to tweak.

```
  -o DB_FILE_PATH, --output-db-path DB_FILE_PATH
                        Output file path for the new database.
  --description TEXT_FILE
                        A plain text file that contains some description about
                        the project. You can use Markdwon syntax. The
                        description text will be rendered and shown in all
                        relevant interfaces, including the anvi'o interactive
                        interface, or anvi'o summary outputs.
  -L INT, --split-length INT
                        Anvi'o splits very long contigs into smaller pieces,
                        without actually splitting them for real. These
                        'virtual' splits improves the efficacy of the
                        visualization step, and changing the split size gives
                        freedom to the user to adjust the resolution of their
                        display when necessary. The default value is (20000).
                        If you are planning to use your contigs database for
                        metagenomic binning, we advise you to not go below
                        10,000 (since the lower the split size is, the more
                        items to show in the display, and decrasing the split
                        size does not really help much to binning). But if you
                        are thinking about using this parameter for ad hoc
                        investigations other than binning, you should ignore
                        our advice, and set the split size as low as you want.
                        If you do not want your contigs to be split, you can
                        set the split size to '0' or any other negative
                        integer (lots of unnecessary freedom here, enjoy!).
  -K INT, --kmer-size INT
                        K-mer size for k-mer frequency calculations. The
                        default k-mer size for composition-based analyses is
                        4, historically. Although tetra-nucleotide frequencies
                        seem to offer the the sweet spot of sensitivity,
                        information density, and manageable number of
                        dimensions for clustering approaches, you are welcome
                        to experiment (but maybe you should leave it as is for
                        your first set of analyses).
  --skip-mindful-splitting
                        By default, anvi'o attempts to prevent soft-splitting
                        large contigs by cutting prper gene calles to make
                        sure a single gene is not broken into multiple splits.
                        This requires a careful examination of where genes
                        start and end, and to find best locations to split
                        contigs with respect to this informtion. So, when the
                        user asks for a split size of, say, 1,000, it serves
                        as a mere suggestion. When this flag is used, anvi'o
                        does what the user wants and creates splits at desired
                        lengths (although some functionality may become
                        unavailable for the projects that rely on a contigs
                        database that is initiated this way).
```



**GENES IN CONTIGS:**   Expert thingies.

```
  --skip-gene-calling   By default, generating an anvi'o contigs database
                        includes the identification of open reading frames in
                        contigs by running a bacterial gene caller. Declaring
                        this flag will by-pass that process. If you prefer,
                        you can later import your own gene calling results
                        into the database.
  --prodigal-translation-table INT
                        This is a parameter to pass to the Prodigal for a
                        specific translation table. This parameter corresponds
                        to the paramter `-g` in Prodigal, the default value of
                        which is 11 (so if you do not set anything, it will be
                        set to 11 in Prodigal runtime. Please refer to the
                        Prodigal documentation to determina what is the right
                        translation table for you if you think you need it.)
  --external-gene-calls GENE-CALLS
                        A TAB-delimited file to utilize external gene calls.
                        The file must have these columns: 'gene_callers_id' (a
                        unique integer number for each gene call, start from
                        1), 'contig' (the contig name the gene call is found),
                        'start' (start position, integer), 'stop' (stop
                        position, integer), 'direction' (the direction of the
                        gene open reading frame; can be 'f' or 'r'), 'partial'
                        (whether it is a complete gene call, or a partial one;
                        must be 1 for partial calls, and 0 for complete
                        calls), 'source' (the gene caller), and 'version' (the
                        version of the gene caller, i.e., v2.6.7 or v1.0). An
                        example file can be found via the URL
                        https://goo.gl/TqCWT2
  --ignore-internal-stop-codons
                        This is only relevant when you have an external gene
                        calls file. If anvi'o figures out that your custom
                        gene calls result in amino acid seqeunces with stop
                        codons in the middle, it will complain about it. You
                        can use this flag to tell anvi'o to don't check for
                        internal stop codons, EVEN THOUGH IT MEANS THERE IS
                        MOST LIKELY SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR EXTERNAL GENE
                        CALLS FILE. Anvi'o will understand that sometimes we
                        don't want to care, and will not judge you. Instead,
                        it will replace every stop codon residue in the amino
                        acid sequence with an 'X' character. Please let us
                        know if you used this and things failed, so we can
                        tell you that you shouldn't have really used it if you
                        didn't like failures at the first place (smiley).

## anvi-gen-gene-consensus-sequences

Collapse variability for a set of genes across samples





**Usage**

```
anvi-gen-gene-consensus-sequences [-h] -p PROFILE_DB -c CONTIGS_DB
                                  [--gene-caller-ids GENE_CALLER_IDS]
                                  [--genes-of-interest FILE]
                                  [--samples-of-interest FILE]
                                  [-o FILE_PATH] [--tab-delimited]
                                  [--engine ENGINE] [--contigs-mode]
                                  [--compress-samples]
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  --compress-samples    Normally all samples with variation will have their
                        own consensus sequence. If this flag is provided, the
                        coverages from each sample of interest will be summed
                        and only a single consenus sequence for each
                        gene/contig will be output.
```



**DATABASES:**   Declaring relevant anvi&#39;o databases. First things first.

```
  -p PROFILE_DB, --profile-db PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o profile database
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
```



**FOCUS:**   What do we want? A consensus sequence for a gene, or a list of genes. From
  where do we want it? All samples, by default. When do we want it? Whenever
  it is convenient.

```
  --gene-caller-ids GENE_CALLER_IDS
                        Gene caller ids. Multiple of them can be declared
                        separated by a delimiter (the default is a comma). In
                        anvi-gen-variability-profile, if you declare nothing
                        you will get all genes matching your other filtering
                        criteria. In other programs, you may get everything,
                        nothing, or an error. It really depends on the
                        situation. Fortunately mistakes are cheap, so it's
                        worth a try.
  --genes-of-interest FILE
                        A file with anvi'o gene caller IDs. There should be
                        only one column in the file, and each line should
                        correspond to a unique gene caller id (without a
                        column header).
  --samples-of-interest FILE
                        A file with samples names. There should be only one
                        column in the file, and each line should correspond to
                        a unique sample name (without a column header).
```



**OUTPUT:**   Output file and output style

```
  -o FILE_PATH, --output-file FILE_PATH
                        The output file name. The boring default is
                        "genes.fa". You can change the output file format to a
                        TAB-delimited file using teh flag `--tab-delimited`,
                        in which case please do not forget to change the file
                        name, too.
  --tab-delimited       Use the TAB-delimited format for the output file.
```



**EXTRAS:**   Parameters that will help you to do a very precise analysis. If you
  declare nothing from this bunch, you will get &quot;everything&quot; to play with,
  which is not necessarily a good thing...

```
  --engine ENGINE       Varaibility engine. The default is 'NT'.
  --contigs-mode        Use this flag to output consensus sequences of
                        contigs, instead of the default, which is genes
```





## anvi-gen-gene-level-stats-databases

A program to compute genes databases for a ginen set of bins stored in an
anvi&#39;o collection. Genes databases store gene-level coverage and detection
statistics, and they are usually computed and generated automatically when
they are required (such as running anvi-interactive with `--gene-mode` flag).
This program allows you to pre-compute them if you don&#39;t want them to be done
all at once.





**Usage**

```
anvi-gen-gene-level-stats-databases [-h] -c CONTIGS_DB -p PROFILE_DB

                                    [-B FILE_PATH]
                                    [--zeros-are-outliers]

                                    [--just-do-it]
```

**Parameters**



**INPUT DATABASES:**   Which anvi&#39;o databases do you wish to work today?

```
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
  -p PROFILE_DB, --profile-db PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o profile database
```



**BIN(S) AND COLLECTION:**   You can select a bin, multiple bins, or you can simply focus on every bin
  in a collection by providing only a collection name. Once you are done
  with your selection, anvi&#39;o will generate an individual genes database for
  each of the bin it finds.

```
  -C COLLECTION_NAME, --collection-name COLLECTION_NAME
                        Collection name.
  -b BIN_NAME, --bin-id BIN_NAME
                        Bin name you are interested in.
  -B FILE_PATH, --bin-ids-file FILE_PATH
                        Text file for bins (each line should be a unique bin
                        id).
```



**ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS:**   These parameters are those that are critical to identify outlier
  nucleotide positions and how to define what should be included in those
  calculations. In most cases you can leave them as is, and things are going
  to be alright.

```
  --zeros-are-outliers  If you want all zero coverage positions to be treated
                        like outliers then use this flag. The reason to treat
                        zero coverage as outliers is because when mapping
                        reads to a reference we could get many zero positions
                        due to accessory genes. These positions then skew the
                        average values that we compute.
  --outliers-threshold NUM
                        Threshold to use for the outlier detection. The
                        default value is '1.5'. Absolute deviation around the
                        median is used. To read more about the method please
                        refer to: 'How to Detect and Handle Outliers' by Boris
                        Iglewicz and David Hoaglin
                        (doi:10.1016/j.jesp.2013.03.013).
```



**PARAMETERS OF CONVENIENCE:**   They say they save lives.

```
  --just-do-it          Don't bother me with questions or warnings, just do
                        it.

## anvi-gen-genomes-storage

Create a genome storage from internal or external genomes for a pan genome
analysis.





**Usage**

```
anvi-gen-genomes-storage [-h] [-e FILE_PATH] [-i FILE_PATH]
                         [--gene-caller GENE-CALLER] -o FILE_PATH
```

**Parameters**



**EXTERNAL GENOMES:**   External genomes listed as anvi&#39;o contigs databases. As in, you have one
  or more genomes say from NCBI you want to work with, and you created an
  anvi&#39;o contigs database for each one of them.

```
  -e FILE_PATH, --external-genomes FILE_PATH
                        A two-column TAB-delimited flat text file that lists
                        anvi'o contigs databases. The first item in the header
                        line should read 'name', and the second should read
                        'contigs_db_path'. Each line in the file should
                        describe a single entry, where the first column is the
                        name of the genome (or MAG), and the second column is
                        the anvi'o contigs database generated for this genome.
```



**INTERNAL GENOMES:**   Genome bins stored in an anvi&#39;o profile databases as collections.

```
  -i FILE_PATH, --internal-genomes FILE_PATH
                        A five-column TAB-delimited flat text file. The header
                        line must contain thse columns: 'name', 'bin_id',
                        'collection_id', 'profile_db_path', 'contigs_db_path'.
                        Each line should list a single entry, where 'name' can
                        be any name to describe the anvi'o bin identified as
                        'bin_id' that is stored in a collection.
```



**PRO STUFF:**   Things you may not have to change. But you never know (unless you read the
  help).

```
  --gene-caller GENE-CALLER
                        The gene caller to utilize. Anvi'o supports multiple
                        gene callers, and some operations (including this one)
                        requires an explicit mentioning of which one to use.
                        The default is 'prodigal', but it will not be enough
                        if you if you were a rebel adn have used `--external-
                        gene-callers` or something.
```



**OUTPUT:**   Give it a nice name. Must end with &#39;-GENOMES.db&#39;. This is primarily due to
  the fact that there are other .db files used throughout anvi&#39;o and it
  would be better to distinguish this very special file from them.

```
  -o FILE_PATH, --output-file FILE_PATH
                        File path to store results.
```

                        Get functional annotations for a specific annotation
                        source. You can use the flag '--list-annotation-
                        sources' to learn about what sources are available.
  -l, --list-annotation-sources
                        List available functional annotation sources.
```

                        Program name.
```





## anvi-gen-structure-database

Identifies genes in your contigs database that encode proteins that are
homologous to proteins with solved structures. If sufficiently similar
homologs are identified, they are used as structural templates to predict the
3D structure of proteins in your contigs database. This means we are at the
mercy of structural biologists: if they have not solved a structure of a
protein sufficiently similar in AA sequence to yours, this isn&#39;t going to
work. But it&#39;s worth a try! The software we are using is MODELLER, more of
which can be learned about at https://salilab.org/modeller/, or in our
tutorial, which doesn&#39;t exist yet FIXME





**Usage**

```
anvi-gen-structure-database [-h] -c CONTIGS_DB
                            [--genes-of-interest FILE]
                            [--gene-caller-ids GENE_CALLER_IDS]
                            [-o DB_FILE_PATH] [--dump-dir DUMP_DIR]
                            [--num-models NUM_MODELS]
                            [--deviation DEVIATION]
                            [--modeller-database MODELLER_DATABASE]
                            [--scoring-method SCORING_METHOD]
                            [--very-fast]
                            [--percent-identical-cutoff PERCENT_IDENTICAL_CUTOFF]
                            [--max-number-templates MAX_NUMBER_TEMPLATES]
                            [--skip-DSSP]
                            [--modeller-executable MODELLER_EXECUTABLE]
```

**Parameters**



**DATABASES:**   Declaring relevant anvi&#39;o databases. First things first.

```
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
```



**GENES:**   Specifying which genes you want to be modelled.

```
  --genes-of-interest FILE
                        A file with anvi'o gene caller IDs. There should be
                        only one column in the file, and each line should
                        correspond to a unique gene caller id (without a
                        column header).
  --gene-caller-ids GENE_CALLER_IDS
                        Gene caller ids. Multiple of them can be declared
                        separated by a delimiter (the default is a comma). In
                        anvi-gen-variability-profile, if you declare nothing
                        you will get all genes matching your other filtering
                        criteria. In other programs, you may get everything,
                        nothing, or an error. It really depends on the
                        situation. Fortunately mistakes are cheap, so it's
                        worth a try.
```



**OUTPUT:**   Output file and output style.

```
  -o DB_FILE_PATH, --output-db-path DB_FILE_PATH
                        Output file path for the new database.
  --dump-dir DUMP_DIR   Modelling and annotating structures requires a lot of
                        moving parts, each which have their own outputs. The
                        output of this program is a structure database
                        containing the pertinent results of this computation,
                        however a lot of stuff doesn't make the cut. By
                        providing a directory for this parameter you will get,
                        in addition to the structure database, a directory
                        containing the raw output for everything.
```



**MODELLER PARAMS:**   Parameters for MODELLER&#39;s homology modeling.

```
  --num-models NUM_MODELS, -N NUM_MODELS
                        This parameter determines the number of predicted
                        structures that are solved for a given protein. The
                        original atomic positions for each model are perturbed
                        by an amount defined by --deviation, which leads to
                        differences between each model. Therefore, whichever
                        of the N models is chosen to be the "best" model is
                        more likely to be accurate when --num-models is high,
                        since more of the solution space is searched. It
                        should be kept in mind that the largest determinant of
                        a model's accuracy is determined by the protein
                        templates used, so no need to go overboard with an
                        excessively large --num-models. The default is 3.
  --deviation DEVIATION, -d DEVIATION
                        Deviation (angstroms)
  --modeller-database MODELLER_DATABASE, -D MODELLER_DATABASE
                        Which database do you want to search the structures
                        of? Default is "pdb_95". If you have your own database
                        it must have either the extension .bin or .pir. If you
                        don't have a database or don't know what this means,
                        don't worry, we will both inform you and take care of
                        you.
  --scoring-method SCORING_METHOD, -b SCORING_METHOD
                        How should the best model be decided? The metric used
                        could be any of GA341_score, DOPE_score, and molpdf.
                        GA341 is an absolute measure, where a good model will
                        have a score near 1.0, whereas anything below 0.6 can
                        be considered bad. DOPE and molpdf scores are relative
                        energy measures, where lower scores are better. DOPE
                        has been generally shown to be a better distinguisher
                        between good and bad models than molpdf. By default,
                        DOPE is used. To learn more see the MODELLER tutorial:
                        https://salilab.org/modeller/tutorial/basic.html.
  --very-fast           If provided, a very fast optimization is done for each
                        model at the cost of accuracy. It is recommended to
                        use a --num-models of 1, since the optimization is so
                        crude that all models will likely converge to the same
                        solution.
  --percent-identical-cutoff PERCENT_IDENTICAL_CUTOFF, -p PERCENT_IDENTICAL_CUTOFF
                        If a protein in the database has a proper percent
                        identity to the gene of interest that is greater than
                        or equal to --percent-identical-cutoff, then it is
                        used as a template. Otherwise it is not. Here we
                        define proper percent identity as the percentage of
                        amino acids in the gene of interest that are identical
                        to an entry in the database given the sequence length
                        of the gene of interest. For example, if there is 100%
                        identity between the gene of interest and the template
                        over the length of the alignment, but the alignment
                        length is only half of the gene of interest sequence
                        length, then the proper percent identical is 50%.
                        (This helps us avoid the inflation of identity scores
                        due to only partially good matches). The default is
                        30.
  --max-number-templates MAX_NUMBER_TEMPLATES, -T MAX_NUMBER_TEMPLATES
                        Generally speaking it is best to use as many templates
                        as possible given that they have high proper percent
                        identity to the gene of interest. Taken from https://s
                        alilab.org/modeller/methenz/andras/node4.html: 'The
                        use of several templates generally increases the model
                        accuracy. One strength of MODELLER is that it can
                        combine information from multiple template structures,
                        in two ways. First, multiple template structures may
                        be aligned with different domains of the target, with
                        little overlap between them, in which case the
                        modeling procedure can construct a homology-based
                        model of the whole target sequence. Second, the
                        template structures may be aligned with the same part
                        of the target, in which case the modeling procedure is
                        likely to automatically build the model on the locally
                        best template [43,44]. In general, it is frequently
                        beneficial to include in the modeling process all the
                        templates that differ substantially from each other,
                        if they share approximately the same overall
                        similarity to the target sequence.' The default is 5.
```



**EXTRA:**   Everything else.

```
  --skip-DSSP           Dictionary of Secondary Structure of Proteins (DSSP)
                        is a program that takes as its input a protein
                        structure file and outputs predicted secondary
                        structure (alpha helix, beta strand, etc.), measures
                        of solvent accessibility, and hydrogen bonds for each
                        residue in the protein. If for some reason you don't
                        want this, provide this flag.
  --modeller-executable MODELLER_EXECUTABLE
                        The MODELLER program to use. For example, `mod9.19`.
                        The default is `mod9.19`

                        column in the file, and each line should correspond to
                        a unique sample name (without a column header).
  --num-positions-from-each-split INT
                        Each split may have one or more variable positions. By
                        default, anvi'o will report every SNV position found
                        in a given split. This parameter will help you to
                        define a cutoff for the maximum number of SNVs to be
                        reported from a split (if the number of SNVs is more
                        than the number you declare using this parameter, the
                        positions will be randomly subsampled).
  -m INT, --min-scatter INT
                        This one is tricky. If you have N samples in your
                        dataset, a given variable position x in one of your
                        splits can split your N samples into `t` groups based
                        on the identity of the variation they harbor at
                        position x. For instance, `t` would have been 1, if
                        all samples had the same type of variation at position
                        x (which would not be very interesting, because in
                        this case position x would have zero contribution to a
                        deeper understanding of how these samples differ based
                        on variability. When `t` > 1, it would mean that
                        identities at position x across samples do differ. But
                        how much scattering occurs based on position x when t
                        > 1? If t=2, how many samples ended in each group?
                        Obviously, even distribution of samples across groups
                        may tell us something different than uneven
                        distribution of samples across groups. So, this
                        parameter filters out any x if 'the number of samples
                        in the second largest group' (=scatter) is less than
                        -m. Here is an example: lets assume you have 7
                        samples. While 5 of those have AG, 2 of them have TC
                        at position x. This would mean scatter of x is 2. If
                        you set -m to 2, this position would not be reported
                        in your output matrix. The default value for -m is 0,
                        which means every `x` found in the database and
                        survived previous filtering criteria will be reported.
                        Naturally, -m can not be more than half of the number
                        of samples. Please refer to the user documentation if
                        this is confusing.
  -r RATIO, --min-ratio-of-competings-nts RATIO
                        Minimum ratio of the competing nucleotides at a given
                        position. Default is 0.
  -o FILE_PATH, --output-file FILE_PATH
                        File path to store results.
```





## anvi-gen-variability-network

A program to generate a network description from an anvi&#39;o variability
profile.





**Usage**

```
anvi-gen-variability-network [-h] -i VARIABILITY_PROFILE
                             [-n NUM_POSITIONS] [-o FILE_PATH]
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -i VARIABILITY_PROFILE, --input-file VARIABILITY_PROFILE
                        The anvi'o variability profile. Please see `anvi-gen-
                        variability-profile` to generate one.
  -n NUM_POSITIONS, --max-num-unique-positions NUM_POSITIONS
                        Maximum number of unique positions to be used in the
                        network. This may be one way to avoid extremely large
                        network descriptions that would defeat the purpose of
                        a quick visualization. If there are more unique
                        positions in the variability profile, the program will
                        randomly select a subset of them to match the `max-
                        num-unique-positions`. The default is 0, which means
                        all positions should be reported. Remember that the
                        number of nodes in the network will also depend on the
                        number of samples described in the variability
                        profile.
  -o FILE_PATH, --output-file FILE_PATH
                        File path to store results.
```

                             [--only-if-structure] [--skip-synonymity]
```

**Parameters**



**DATABASES:**   Declaring relevant anvi&#39;o databases. First things first.

```
  -p PROFILE_DB, --profile-db PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o profile database
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
  -s STRUCTURE_DB, --structure-db STRUCTURE_DB
                        Anvi'o structure database.
```



**SPLITS:**   Declaring relevant splits for the analysis. There are three ways to do it:
  1) you can give a file path with split names, 2) you can provide a
  collection id with a bin name, or 3) you can give a list or a file path
  containing gene caller ids.

```
  --splits-of-interest FILE
                        A file with split names. There should be only one
                        column in the file, and each line should correspond to
                        a unique split name.
  -C COLLECTION_NAME, --collection-name COLLECTION_NAME
                        Collection name.
  -b BIN_NAME, --bin-id BIN_NAME
                        Bin name you are interested in.
  --genes-of-interest FILE
                        A file with anvi'o gene caller IDs. There should be
                        only one column in the file, and each line should
                        correspond to a unique gene caller id (without a
                        column header).
  --gene-caller-ids GENE_CALLER_IDS
                        Gene caller ids. Multiple of them can be declared
                        separated by a delimiter (the default is a comma). In
                        anvi-gen-variability-profile, if you declare nothing
                        you will get all genes matching your other filtering
                        criteria. In other programs, you may get everything,
                        nothing, or an error. It really depends on the
                        situation. Fortunately mistakes are cheap, so it's
                        worth a try.
```



**OUTPUT:**   Output file and output style

```
  -o FILE_PATH, --output-file FILE_PATH
                        File path to store results.
  --samples-of-interest FILE
                        A file with samples names. There should be only one
                        column in the file, and each line should correspond to
                        a unique sample name (without a column header).
  --quince-mode         The default behavior is to report base frequencies of
                        nucleotide positions only if there is any variation
                        reported during profiling (which by default uses some
                        heuristics to minimize the impact of error-driven
                        variation). So, if there are 10 samples, and a given
                        position has been reported as a varaible site during
                        profiling in only one of those samples, there will be
                        no information will be stored in the database for the
                        remaining 9. When this flag is used, we go back to
                        each sample, and report base frequencies for each
                        sample at this position even if they do not vary. It
                        will take considerably longer to report when this flag
                        is on, and the use of it will increase the file size
                        dramatically, however it is inevitable for some
                        statistical approaches (as well as for some beautiful
                        visualizations).
  --include-contig-names
                        Use this flag if you would like contig names for each
                        variable position to be included in the output file as
                        a column. By default, we do not include contig names
                        since they can practically double the output file size
                        without any actual benefit in most cases.
  --include-split-names
                        Use this flag if you would like split names for each
                        variable position to be included in the output file as
                        a column.
  --compute-gene-coverage-stats
                        If provided, gene coverage statistics will be appended
                        to the table for each entry. This is very useful
                        information, but will not be included by default
                        because it is an expensive opeation, and you a busy
                        person.
```



**EXTRAS:**   Parameters that will help you to do a very precise analysis. If you
  declare nothing from this bunch, you will get &quot;everything&quot; to play with,
  which is not necessarily a good thing...

```
  --engine ENGINE       Varaibility engine. The default is 'NT'.
  --num-positions-from-each-split INT
                        Each split may have one or more variable positions. By
                        default, anvi'o will report every SNV position found
                        in a given split. This parameter will help you to
                        define a cutoff for the maximum number of SNVs to be
                        reported from a split (if the number of SNVs is more
                        than the number you declare using this parameter, the
                        positions will be randomly subsampled).
  --min-coverage-in-each-sample INT
                        Minimum coverage of a given variable nucleotide
                        position in all samples. If a nucleotide position is
                        covered less than this value even in one sample, it
                        will be removed from the analysis. Default is 0.
  -r FLOAT, --min-departure-from-reference FLOAT
                        Takes a value between 0 and 1, where 1 is maximum
                        divergence from the reference. Default is 0.000000.
                        The reference here observation that corresponds to a
                        given position in the mapped context.
  -z FLOAT, --max-departure-from-reference FLOAT
                        Similar to '--min-departure-from-reference', but
                        defines an upper limit for divergence. The default is
                        1.000000.
  -j FLOAT, --min-departure-from-consensus FLOAT
                        Takes a value between 0 and 1, where 1 is maximum
                        divergence from the consensus for a given position.
                        The default is 0.000000. The consensus is the most
                        frequent observation at a given positon.
  -a FLOAT, --max-departure-from-consensus FLOAT
                        Similar to '--min-departure-from-consensus', but
                        defines an upper limit for divergence. The default is
                        1.000000.
  -x NUM_SAMPLES, --min-occurrence NUM_SAMPLES
                        Minimum number of samples a nucleotide position should
                        be reported as variable. Default is 1. If you set it
                        to 2, for instance, each eligable variable position
                        will be expected to appear in at least two samples,
                        which will reduce the impact of stochastic, or
                        unintelligeable varaible positions.
  --only-if-structure   If provided, your genes of interest will be further
                        subset to only include genes with structures in your
                        structure database, and therefore must be supplied in
                        conjunction with a structure database, i.e. `-s
                        <your_structure_database>`. If you did not specify
                        genes of interest, ALL genes will be subset to those
                        that have structures.
  --skip-synonymity     Computing synonymity can be an expensive operation for
                        large data sets. Provide this flag to skip computing
                        synonymity. It only makes sense to provide this flag
                        when using --engine CDN.

  -B FILE_PATH, --bin-ids-file FILE_PATH
                        Text file for bins (each line should be a unique bin
                        id).
```



**OPTIONAL PARAMS FOR CONTIGS:** 

```
  --contigs-of-interest FILE
                        A file with contig names. There should be only one
                        column in the file, and each line should correspond to
                        a unique split name.
```



**OPTIONAL PARAMS FOR GENE CALLS:** 

```
  --gene-caller-ids GENE_CALLER_IDS
                        Gene caller ids. Multiple of them can be declared
                        separated by a delimiter (the default is a comma). In
                        anvi-gen-variability-profile, if you declare nothing
                        you will get all genes matching your other filtering
                        criteria. In other programs, you may get everything,
                        nothing, or an error. It really depends on the
                        situation. Fortunately mistakes are cheap, so it's
                        worth a try.

                           FILE_PATH
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -i INPUT_BAM, --input-file INPUT_BAM
                        Sorted and indexed BAM file to analyze.
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-

  --gene-caller-id GENE_CALLER_ID
                        A single gene id.
  --return-AA-frequencies-instead
                        By default, anvi'o will return codon frequencies (as
                        the name suggests), but you can ask for amino acid
                        frequencies instead, simply because you always need
                        more data and more stuff. You're lucky this time, but
                        is there an end to this? Will you ever be satisfied
                        with what you have? Anvi'o needs answers.
  -o FILE_PATH, --output-file FILE_PATH

## anvi-get-enriched-functions-per-pan-group

A program that takes a pangenome, and a categorical layer additional data
item, and reports back the functions enriched in per category.

`pangenomics` `functions` 


**Example uses and other resources**


* [An example usage of the program in the context of the Prochlorococcus metapangenome from Delmont and Eren 2018 is included in the pangenomics tutorial](http://merenlab.org/2016/11/08/pangenomics-v2/)



**Usage**

```
anvi-get-enriched-functions-per-pan-group [-h] -p PAN_DB
                                          [-g GENOMES_STORAGE]
                                          [--category-variable CATEGORY]
                                          [--annotation-source SOURCE NAME]
                                          [-l] -o FILE_PATH [-F FILE]
                                          [-E FLOAT]
                                          [--core-threshold FLOAT]
                                          [-P FLOAT]
                                          [--false-detection-rate FLOAT]
```

**Parameters**



**INPUT FILES:**   Input files from the pangenome analysis.

```
  -p PAN_DB, --pan-db PAN_DB
                        Anvi'o pan database
  -g GENOMES_STORAGE, --genomes-storage GENOMES_STORAGE
                        Anvi'o genomes storage file
```



**CATEGORY VARIABLE AND FUNCTIONAL ANNOTATION SOURCE:**   This is the additional layer data item in which your genomes are split
  into multiple groups. So anvi&#39;o can figure out what functions are specific
  to each group of genomes in your pangenomic analysis. If this is not
  making any sense, please take a look at the online tutorial for
  pangenomics (http://merenlab.org/2016/11/08/pangenomics-v2/).

```
  --category-variable CATEGORY
                        The additional layers data variable name that divides
                        layers into multiple categories.
  --annotation-source SOURCE NAME
                        Get functional annotations for a specific annotation
                        source. You can use the flag '--list-annotation-
                        sources' to learn about what sources are available.
  -l, --list-annotation-sources
                        List available functional annotation sources.
```



**REPORTING:**   Output and stuff.

```
  -o FILE_PATH, --output-file FILE_PATH
                        File path to store results.
  -F FILE, --functional-occurrence-table-output FILE
                        Saves the presence/absence information for functions
                        in genomes in a TAB-delimited format. A file name must
                        be provided. To learn more about how the
                        presence/absence is computed, please refer to the
                        tutorial.
```



**OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:**   Parameters to help you filter the output.

```
  -E FLOAT, --min-function-enrichment FLOAT
                        Only report functions for which the min enrichment is
                        above the provided value. Default is 0.0.
  --core-threshold FLOAT
                        Takes a value between 0 and 1, where 1 means that only
                        functions occuring in all genomes of a group would be
                        considered as core functions of that group. Default is
                        1.0.
  -P FLOAT, --min-portion-occurrence-of-function-in-group FLOAT
                        Takes a value between 0 and 1, where 1 means that only
                        functions that occur in all members of one of the
                        compared groups will be included in the output.
                        Default is 0.0.
  --false-detection-rate FLOAT, --FDR FLOAT
                        Takes a value between 0 and 1, to determine the false
                        detection rate that will be used for the
                        Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. Default is 0.1.
```





## anvi-get-sequences-for-gene-calls

A script to get back sequences of a list of genes





**Usage**

```
anvi-get-sequences-for-gene-calls [-h] -c CONTIGS_DB
                                  [--gene-caller-ids GENE_CALLER_IDS]
                                  -o FILE_PATH [--delimiter CHAR]
                                  [--report-extended-deflines]
                                  [--wrap WRAP] [--export-gff3]
                                  [--get-aa-sequences]
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
  --gene-caller-ids GENE_CALLER_IDS
                        Gene caller ids. Multiple of them can be declared
                        separated by a delimiter (the default is a comma). In
                        anvi-gen-variability-profile, if you declare nothing
                        you will get all genes matching your other filtering
                        criteria. In other programs, you may get everything,
                        nothing, or an error. It really depends on the
                        situation. Fortunately mistakes are cheap, so it's
                        worth a try.
  -o FILE_PATH, --output-file FILE_PATH
                        File path to store results.
  --delimiter CHAR      The delimiter to parse multiple input terms. The
                        default is ','.
  --report-extended-deflines
                        When declared, the deflines in the resulting FASTA
                        file will contain more information.
  --wrap WRAP           When to wrap sequences when storing them in a FASTA
                        file. The default is '120'. A value of '0' would be
                        equivalent to 'do not wrap'.
  --export-gff3         If this is true, the output file will be in GFF3
                        format.
  --get-aa-sequences    Store amino acid sequences instead.
```





## anvi-get-sequences-for-gene-clusters

Do cool stuff with gene clusters in anvi&#39;o pan genomes





**Usage**

```

                                     [--list-aligners] [--just-do-it]
```

**Parameters**



**INPUT FILES:**   Input files from the pangenome analysis.

```
  -p PAN_DB, --pan-db PAN_DB
                        Anvi'o pan database
  -g GENOMES_STORAGE, --genomes-storage GENOMES_STORAGE
                        Anvi'o genomes storage file
```



**OUTPUT:**   You get to chose an output file name to report things. The default will be
  an ugly name. So, be explicit.

```
  -o FILE_PATH, --output-file FILE_PATH
                        File path to store results.
  --report-DNA-sequences
                        By default, this program reports amino acid sequences.
                        You can change that behavior and as for DNA sequences
                        instead using this flag.
```



**SELECTION:**   Which gene clusters should be reported. You can ask for a single gene
  cluster, or multiple ones listed in a file, or you can use a collection
  and bin name to list gene clusters of interest. If you give nothing, this
  program will export alignments for every single gene cluster found in the
  profile database (and this is called &#39;customer service&#39;).

```
  --gene-cluster-id GENE_CLUSTER_ID
                        Gene cluster ID you are interested in.
  --gene-cluster-ids-file FILE_PATH
                        Text file for gene clusters (each line should contain
                        be a unique gene cluster id).
  -C COLLECTION_NAME, --collection-name COLLECTION_NAME
                        Collection name.
  -b BIN_NAME, --bin-id BIN_NAME
                        Bin name you are interested in.
```



**ADVANCED FILTERS:**   If you are here you must be looking for ways to specify exactly what you
  want from that database of gene clusters. These filters will be applied to
  what your previous selections reported.

```
  --min-num-genomes-gene-cluster-occurs INTEGER
                        This filter will remove gene clusters from your
                        report. Let's assume you have 100 genomes in your pan
                        genome analysis. You can use this parameter if you
                        want to work only with gene clusters that occur in at
                        least X number of genomes. If you say '--min-num-
                        genomes-gene-cluster-occurs 90', each gene cluster in
                        the analysis will be required at least to appear in 90
                        genomes. If a gene occurs in less than that number of
                        genomes, it simply will not be reported. This is
                        especially useful for phylogenomic analyses, where you
                        may want to only focus on gene clusters that are
                        prevalent across the set of genomes you wish to
                        analyze.
  --max-num-genomes-gene-cluster-occurs INTEGER
                        This filter will remove gene clusters from your
                        report. Let's assume you have 100 genomes in your pan
                        genome analysis. You can use this parameter if you
                        want to work only with gene clusters that occur in at
                        most X number of genomes. If you say '--max-num-
                        genomes-gene-cluster-occurs 1', you will get gene
                        clusters that are singletons. Combining this paramter
                        with --min-num-genomes-gene-cluster-occurs can give
                        you a very precise way to filter your gene clusters.
  --min-num-genes-from-each-genome INTEGER
                        This filter will remove gene clusters from your
                        report. If you say '--min-num-genes-from-each-genome
                        2', this filter will remove every gene cluster, to
                        which every genome in your analysis contributed less
                        than 2 genes. This can be useful to find out gene
                        clusters with many genes from many genomes (such as
                        conserved multi-copy genes within a clade).
  --max-num-genes-from-each-genome INTEGER
                        This filter will remove gene clusters from your
                        report. If you say '--max-num-genes-from-each-genome
                        1', every gene cluster that has more than one gene
                        from any genome that contributes to it will be removed
                        from your analysis. This could be useful to remove
                        gene clusters with paralogs from your report for
                        appropriate phylogenomic analyses. For instance, using
                        '--max-num-genes-from-each-genome 1' and 'min-num-
                        genomes-gene-cluster-occurs X' where X is the total
                        number of your genomes, would give you the single-copy
                        gene cluters in your pan genome.
  --max-num-gene-clusters-missing-from-genome INTEGER
                        This filter will remove genomes from your report. If
                        you have a list of gene cluster names, you can use
                        this parameter to omit any genome from your report if
                        it is missing more than a number of genes you desire.
                        For instance, if you have 100 genomes in your pan
                        genome, and you are interested in working only with
                        genomes that have all 5 specific gene clusters of your
                        choice, you can use '--max-num-gene-clusters-missing-
                        from-genome 4' to remove remove the bins that are
                        missing more than 4 of those 5 genes. This is
                        especially useful for phylogenomic analyses. Parameter
                        0 will remove any genome that is missing any of the
                        genes.
  --min-functional-homogeneity-index FLOAT
                        This filter will remove genoe clusters from your
                        report. If you say '--min-functional-homogeneity-index
                        0.3', every gene cluster with a functional homogeneity
                        index less than 0.3 will be removed from your
                        analysis. This can be useful if you only want to look
                        at gene clusters that are highly conserved in
                        resulting funciton
  --max-functional-homogeneity-index FLOAT
                        This filter will remove genoe clusters from your
                        report. If you say '--max-functional-homogeneity-index
                        0.5', every gene cluster with a functional homogeneity
                        index greater than 0.5 will be removed from your
                        analysis. This can be useful if you only want to look
                        at gene clusters that don't seem to be functionally
                        conserved
  --min-geometric-homogeneity-index FLOAT
                        This filter will remove genoe clusters from your
                        report. If you say '--min-geometric-homogeneity-index
                        0.3', every gene cluster with a geometric homogeneity
                        index less than 0.3 will be removed from your
                        analysis. This can be useful if you only want to look
                        at gene clusters that are highly conserved in
                        geometric configuration
  --max-geometric-homogeneity-index FLOAT
                        This filter will remove genoe clusters from your
                        report. If you say '--max-geometric-homogeneity-index
                        0.5', every gene cluster with a geometric homogeneity
                        index greater than 0.5 will be removed from your
                        analysis. This can be useful if you only want to look
                        at gene clusters that have many not be as conserved as
                        others
  --add-into-items-additional-data-table NAME
                        If you use any of the filters, and would like to add
                        the resulting item names into the items additional
                        data table of your database, you can use this
                        parameter. You will need to give a name for these
                        results to be saved. If the given name is already in
                        the items additoinal data table, its contents will be
                        replaced with the new one. Then you can run anvi-
                        interactive or anvi-display-pan to 'see' the results
                        of your filters.

                        for phylogenomic analyses.
  --separator STRING    Characters to separate things (the default is whatever
                        is most suitable).
  --align-with ALIGNER  The multiple sequnce alignment program to use when
                        multiple seqeunce alignment is necessary. To see all
                        available optons, use the flag `--list-aligners`.
  --list-aligners       Show available software for multiple sequence
                        alignment.
```



**TOTALLY IRRELEVANT:**   Just in case you need it.

```
  --just-do-it          Don't bother me with questions or warnings, just do
                        it.

## anvi-get-sequences-for-hmm-hits

Get sequences for HMM hits from many inputs.





**Usage**

```
anvi-get-sequences-for-hmm-hits [-h] [-c CONTIGS_DB] [-p PROFILE_DB]
                                [-C COLLECTION_NAME] [-b BIN_NAME]
                                [-B FILE_PATH] [-e FILE_PATH]
                                [-i FILE_PATH]
                                [--hmm-sources SOURCE NAME]

                                [-o FILE_PATH] [--no-wrap]
                                [--get-aa-sequences]
                                [--concatenate-genes]
                                [--max-num-genes-missing-from-bin INTEGER]
                                [--min-num-bins-gene-occurs INTEGER]
                                [--align-with ALIGNER]
                                [--separator STRING]
                                [--return-best-hit]
```

**Parameters**



**INPUT OPTION #1: CONTIGS DB:**   There are multiple ways to access to sequences. Your first option is to
  provide a contigs database, and call it a day. In this case the program
  will return you everything from it.

```
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
```



**INPUT OPTION #2: CONTIGS DB + PROFLIE DB:**   You can also work with anvi&#39;o profile databases and collections stored in
  them. If you go this way, you still will need to provide a contigs
  database. If you just specify a collection name, you will get hits from
  every bin in it. You can also use the bin name or bin ids file parameters
  to specify your interest more precisely.

```
  -p PROFILE_DB, --profile-db PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o profile database
  -C COLLECTION_NAME, --collection-name COLLECTION_NAME
                        Collection name.
  -b BIN_NAME, --bin-id BIN_NAME
                        Bin name you are interested in.
  -B FILE_PATH, --bin-ids-file FILE_PATH
                        Text file for bins (each line should be a unique bin
                        id).
```



**INPUT OPTION #3: INT/EXTERNAL GENOMES FILE:**   Yes. You can alternatively use as input an internal or external genomes
  file, or both of them together. If you have multiple contigs databases
  without any profile database, you can use the external genomes file. So if
  you just have a bunch of FASTA files and nothing else, this is what you
  need. In contrast, if you want to access to genes in bins described in
  collections stored in anvi&#39;o profile databases, then you can use internal
  genomes file route. Or you can mix the two, because why not. There is not
  much room for excuses here.

```
  -e FILE_PATH, --external-genomes FILE_PATH
                        A two-column TAB-delimited flat text file that lists
                        anvi'o contigs databases. The first item in the header
                        line should read 'name', and the second should read
                        'contigs_db_path'. Each line in the file should
                        describe a single entry, where the first column is the
                        name of the genome (or MAG), and the second column is
                        the anvi'o contigs database generated for this genome.
  -i FILE_PATH, --internal-genomes FILE_PATH
                        A five-column TAB-delimited flat text file. The header
                        line must contain thse columns: 'name', 'bin_id',
                        'collection_id', 'profile_db_path', 'contigs_db_path'.
                        Each line should list a single entry, where 'name' can
                        be any name to describe the anvi'o bin identified as
                        'bin_id' that is stored in a collection.
```



**HMM STUFF:**   This is where you can specify an HMM source, and/or a list of genes to
  filter your results.

```
  --hmm-sources SOURCE NAME
                        Get sequences for a specific list of HMM sources. You
                        can list one or more sources by separating them from
                        each other with a comma character (i.e., '--hmm-
                        sources source_1,source_2,source_3'). If you would
                        like to see a list of available sources in the contigs
                        database, run this program with '--list-hmm-sources'
                        flag.
  --gene-names HMM HIT NAME
                        Get sequences only for a specific gene name. Each name
                        should be separated from each other by a comma
                        character. For instance, if you want to get back only
                        RecA and Ribosomal_L27, you can type '--gene-names
                        RecA,Ribosomal_L27', and you will get any and every
                        hit that matches these names in any source. If you
                        would like to see a list of available gene names, you
                        can use '--list-available-gene-names' flag.
  -l, --list-hmm-sources
                        List available HMM sources in the contigs database and
                        quit.
  -L, --list-available-gene-names
                        List available gene names in HMM sources selection and
                        quit.
```



**THE OUTPUT:**   Where should the output go. It will be a FASTA file, and you better give
  it a nice name..

```
  -o FILE_PATH, --output-file FILE_PATH
                        File path to store results.
  --no-wrap             Do not be wrap sequences nicely in the output file.
```



**THE ALPHABET:**   The sequences are reported in DNA alphabet, but you can also get them
  translated just like all the other cool kids.

```
  --get-aa-sequences    Store amino acid sequences instead.
```



**PHYLOGENOMICS? K!:**   If you want, you can get your sequences concatanated. In this case anwi&#39;o
  will use muscle to align every homolog, and concatenate them the order you
  specified using the `gene-names` argument. Each concatenated sequence will
  be separated from the other ones by the `separator`.

```
  --concatenate-genes   Concatenate output genes in the same order to create a
                        multi-gene alignment output that is suitable for
                        phylogenomic analyses.
  --max-num-genes-missing-from-bin INTEGER
                        This filter removes bins (or genomes) from your
                        analysis. If you have a list of gene names, you can
                        use this parameter to omit any bin (or external
                        genome) that is missing more than a number of genes
                        you desire. For instance, if you have 100 genome bins,
                        and you are interested in working with 5 ribosomal
                        proteins, you can use '--max-num-genes-missing-from-
                        bin 4' to remove remove the bins that are missing more
                        than 4 of those 5 genes. This is especially useful for
                        phylogenomic analyses. Parameter 0 will remove any bin
                        that is missing any of the genes.
  --min-num-bins-gene-occurs INTEGER
                        This filter removes genes from your analysis. Let's
                        assume you have 100 bins to get sequences for HMM
                        hits. If you want to work only with genes among all
                        the hits that occur in at least X number of bins, and
                        discard the rest of them, you can use this flag. If
                        you say '--min-num-bins-gene-occurs 90', each gene in
                        the analysis will be required at least to appear in 90
                        genomes. If a gene occurs in less than that number of
                        genomes, it simply will not be reported. This is
                        especially useful for phylogenomic analyses, where you
                        may want to only focus on genes that are prevalent
                        across the set of genomes you wish to analyze.
  --align-with ALIGNER  The multiple sequnce alignment program to use when
                        multiple seqeunce alignment is necessary. To see all
                        available optons, use the flag `--list-aligners`.
  --separator STRING    A word that will be used to sepaate concatenated gene
                        sequences from each other (IF you are using this
                        program with `--concatenate-genes` flag). The default
                        is "XXX" for amino acid sequences, and "NNN" for DNA
                        sequences
```



**OPTIONAL:**   Everything is optional, but some options are more optional than others.

```
  --return-best-hit     A bin may contain more than one hit for a gene name in
                        a given HMM source. For instance, there may be
                        multiple RecA hits in a genome bin from Campbell et
                        al.. Using this flag, will go through all of the gene
                        names that appear multiple times, and remove all but
                        the one with the lowest e-value. Good for whenever you
                        really need to get only a single copy of single-copy
                        core genes from a genome bin.

                        information about the origin of the bin. If these bins
                        are automatically identified by a program like
                        CONCOCT, this column could contain the program name
                        and version. The source information will be associated
                        with the bin in various interfaces so in a sense it is
                        not *that* critical what it says there, but on the
                        other hand it is, becuse we should also think about
                        people who may end up having to work with what we put
                        together later.
  --contigs-mode        Use this flag if your binning was done on contigs
                        instead of splits. Please refer to the documentation
                        for help.
```





## anvi-import-functions

Parse and store functional annotation of genes.





**Usage**

```
anvi-import-functions [-h] -c CONTIGS_DB [-p PARSER] -i FILES)
                      [FILE(S ...] [--drop-previous-annotations]
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
  -p PARSER, --parser PARSER
                        Parser to make sense of the input files (if you need
                        one). There are currently 1 parsers readily available:
                        ['interproscan']. IT IS OK if you do not select a
                        parser if you have a standard, TAB-delimited input
                        file for funcitonal annotation of genes. If this is
                        not like 2018 and everything is already outdated, you
                        should be able to go to this address and learn
                        everything you need like a boss:
                        http://merenlab.org/2016/06/18/importing-functions/
  -i FILE(S) [FILE(S) ...], --input-files FILE(S) [FILE(S) ...]
                        One or more input files should follow this parameter.
                        The way these files will be handled will depend on
                        which parser you selected (if you did select any).
  --drop-previous-annotations
                        Use this flag if you want anvi'o to remove ALL
                        previous functional annotations for your genes, and
                        then import the new data. The default behavior will
                        add any annotation source into the db incrementally
                        unless there are already annotations from this source.
                        In which case, it will first remove previous
                        annotations for that source only (i.e., if source X is
                        both in the db and in the incoming annotations data,
                        it will replace the content of source X in the db).
```





## anvi-import-items-order

Import a new items order into an anvi&#39;o database





**Usage**

```
anvi-import-items-order [-h] [-i FILE] [-p DB PATH] [--name ORDER NAME]
                        [--make-default]
```

**Parameters**



**CRITICAL INPUT:**   Basically the input file and the target database

```
  -i FILE, --input-order FILE
                        One of the two important things you must provide: the
                        file that contains the items order. The format of this
                        file is important. It can either contain a proper
                        newick tree in it, or a complete list of 'items' in
                        the target database where every line of the file is
                        simply an item name. If you are providing a newick
                        tree, the entire file should be a single line. I know
                        it sounds hard, but you seriously can do this.
  -p DB PATH, --db-path DB PATH
                        An appropriate anvi'o database to import the items
                        order. Currently it can be a profile, pan, or genes
                        database. But you should try your chances with other
                        kinds of databases for fun and games. Basically, if
                        the database contains an items order table, then
                        things will work. Otherwise, you will probably get
                        angry errors back in the worst case scenario.
```



**NOT SO CRITICAL INPUT:**   Because not all parameters are created equal

```
  --name ORDER NAME     What should we call this order? Give it a concise,
                        single-word name.
  --make-default        You have the option to make this order the default
                        order in the database. Which means, anvi'o will use
                        this one when someone runs the program anvi-
                        interactive and presses draw. Big responsibility. But
                        if you have a 'default' state, it will not work
                        because the default items order in the state file
                        overwrites the one that comes from the database. So
                        not that big of a responsibility.
```





## anvi-import-misc-data

Populate additional data or order tables in pan or profile databases for items
or layers (the Swiss army knife-level serious stuff).





**Usage**

```
anvi-import-misc-data [-h] -p PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB -t NAME [-D NAME]
                      [--transpose] [--just-do-it]
                      TAB DELIMITED FILE
```

**Parameters**



**positional arguments:** 

```
  TAB DELIMITED FILE    The input file that describes an additional data for
                        layers or items. The expected format of this file
                        depends on the data table you will target. This can
                        feel complicated, but we promise it is not (you
                        probably have a PhD or working on one, so trust us
                        when we say "it is not complicated"). You need to read
                        the online documentation if this is your first time
                        with this.
```



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -p PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB, --pan-or-profile-db PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o pan or profile database (and even genes
                        database in appropriate contexts).
  -t NAME, --target-data-table NAME
                        The target table is the table you are interested in
                        accessing. Currently it can be 'items','layers', or
                        'layer_orders'. Please see most up-to-date online
                        documentation for more information.
  -D NAME, --target-data-group NAME
                        Data group to focus. Anvi'o misc data tables support
                        associating a set of data keys with a data group. If
                        you have no idea what this is, then probably you don't
                        need it, and anvi'o will take care of you. Note: this
                        flag is IRRELEVANT if you are working with additioanl
                        order data tables.
  --transpose           Transpose the input matrix file before clustering.
  --just-do-it          Don't bother me with questions or warnings, just do
                        it.
```





## anvi-import-state

Import an anvi&#39;o state into a profile database.





**Usage**

```
anvi-import-state [-h] -p PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB -s STATE_FILE -n STATE_NAME
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -p PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB, --pan-or-profile-db PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o pan or profile database (and even genes
                        database in appropriate contexts).
  -s STATE_FILE, --state STATE_FILE
                        JSON serializable anvi'o state file.
  -n STATE_NAME, --name STATE_NAME
                        State name.
```





## anvi-import-taxonomy-for-genes

Import gene-level taxonomy into an anvi&#39;o contigs database.





**Usage**

```
anvi-import-taxonomy-for-genes [-h] -c CONTIGS_DB [-p PARSER] -i FILES)
                               [FILE(S ...] [--just-do-it]
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
  -p PARSER, --parser PARSER
                        Parser to make sense of the input files. There are 3
                        parsers readily available: ['default_matrix',
                        'centrifuge', 'kaiju']. It is OK if you do not select
                        a parser, but in that case there will be no additional
                        contigs available except the identification of single-
                        copy genes in your contigs for later use. Using a
                        parser will not prevent the analysis of single-copy
                        genes, but make anvio more powerful to help you make
                        sense of your results. Please see the documentation,
                        or get in touch with the developers if you have any
                        questions regarding parsers.
  -i FILE(S) [FILE(S) ...], --input-files FILE(S) [FILE(S) ...]
                        Input file(s) for selected parser. Each parser (except
                        "blank") requires input files to process that you
                        generate before running anvio. Please see the
                        documentation for details.
  --just-do-it          Don't bother me with questions or warnings, just do
                        it.
```





## anvi-import-taxonomy-for-layers

Import layers-level taxonomy into an anvi&#39;o additional layer data table in an
anvi&#39;o single-profile database.





**Usage**

```
anvi-import-taxonomy-for-layers [-h] -p PROFILE_DB [--parser PARSER] -i
                                FILES) [FILE(S ...]
                                [--min-abundance PERCENTAGE]
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -p PROFILE_DB, --profile-db PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o profile database
  --parser PARSER       Parser to make sense of the input files. There are 1
                        parsers readily available: ['kraken_hll'].
  -i FILE(S) [FILE(S) ...], --input-files FILE(S) [FILE(S) ...]
                        Input file(s) for selected parser. Each parser (except
                        "blank") requires input files to process that you
                        generate before running anvio. Please see the
                        documentation for details.
  --min-abundance PERCENTAGE
                        Short read-based taxonomy can be extremely noisy.
                        Therefore, here we have defeault minimum percentage
                        cutoff of 0.1% to eliminate any taxon that occurs less
                        than that in a given input file.
```





## anvi-init-bam

Sort/Index BAM files





**Usage**

```
anvi-init-bam [-h] [-o FILE_PATH] BAM_FILE
```

**Parameters**



**positional arguments:** 

```
  BAM_FILE              BAM file to analyze
```



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -o FILE_PATH, --output-file FILE_PATH
                        File path to store results.
```





## anvi-interactive

Start an anvi&#39;o server for the interactive interface





**Usage**

```
anvi-interactive [-h] [-p PROFILE_DB] [-c CONTIGS_DB]
                 [-C COLLECTION_NAME] [--manual-mode] [-f FASTA]
                 [-d VIEW_DATA] [-t NEWICK] [--items-order FLAT_FILE]
                 [-V ADDITIONAL_VIEW] [-A ADDITIONAL_LAYERS]
                 [--view NAME] [--title NAME]
                 [--taxonomic-level {t_phylum,t_class,t_order,t_family,t_genus,t_species}]
                 [--split-hmm-layers] [--hide-outlier-SNVs]
                 [--state-autoload NAME] [--collection-autoload NAME]
                 [--export-svg FILE_PATH] [--gene-mode] [-b BIN_NAME]
                 [--show-views] [--skip-check-names] [-o DIR_PATH]
                 [--dry-run] [--show-states] [--list-collections]
                 [--skip-init-functions] [--skip-auto-ordering]
                 [--distance DISTANCE_METRIC]
                 [--linkage LINKAGE_METHOD] [-I IP_ADDR] [-P INT]
                 [--browser-path PATH] [--read-only] [--server-only]
                 [--password-protected]
```

**Parameters**



**DEFAULT INPUTS:**   The interavtive interface can be started with and without anvi&#39;o
  databases. The default use assumes you have your profile and contigs
  database, however, it is also possible to start the interface using ad hoc
  input files. See &#39;MANUAL INPUT&#39; section for required parameters.

```
  -p PROFILE_DB, --profile-db PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o profile database
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
  -C COLLECTION_NAME, --collection-name COLLECTION_NAME
                        If you have a collection in your profile database, you
                        can use this flag to start the interactive interface
                        with a tree showing your bins in your collection,
                        instead of each split. This is very useful when you
                        have imported your external binning results into
                        anvi'o, and want to see the distribution of your bins
                        across samples. In these cases anvi'o will cluster
                        your bins and based on multiple metrics. Because this
                        particular clustering will be done on the fly within
                        anvi'o interactive class, you get to define a
                        disntance metric and a linkage method using --linkage
                        and --distance parameters if you want!
```



**MANUAL INPUTS:**   Mandatory input parameters to start the interactive interface without
  anvi&#39;o databases.

```
  --manual-mode         Using this flag, you can run the interactive interface
                        in an ad hoc manner using input files you curated
                        instead of standard output files generated by an
                        anvi'o run. In the manual mode you will be asked to
                        provide a profile database. In this mode a profile
                        database is only used to store 'state' of the
                        interactive interface so you can reload your visual
                        settings when you re-analyze the same files again. If
                        the profile database you provide does not exist,
                        anvi'o will create an empty one for you.
  -f FASTA, --fasta-file FASTA
                        A FASTA-formatted input file
  -d VIEW_DATA, --view-data VIEW_DATA
                        A TAB-delimited file for view data
  -t NEWICK, --tree NEWICK
                        NEWICK formatted tree structure
  --items-order FLAT_FILE
                        A flat file that contains the order of items you wish
                        the display using the interactive interface. You may
                        want to use this if you have a specific order of items
                        in your mind, and do not want to display a tree in the
                        middle (or simply you don't have one). The file format
                        is simple: each line should have an item name, and
                        there should be no header.
```



**ADDITIONAL STUFF:**   Parameters to provide additional layers, views, or layer data.

```
  -V ADDITIONAL_VIEW, --additional-view ADDITIONAL_VIEW
                        A TAB-delimited file for an additional view to be used
                        in the interface. This file file should contain all
                        split names, and values for each of them in all
                        samples. Each column in this file must correspond to a
                        sample name. Content of this file will be called
                        'user_view', which will be available as a new item in
                        the 'views' combo box in the interface
  -A ADDITIONAL_LAYERS, --additional-layers ADDITIONAL_LAYERS
                        A TAB-delimited file for additional layers for splits.
                        The first column of this file must be split names, and
                        the remaining columns should be unique attributes. The
                        file does not need to contain all split names, or
                        values for each split in every column. Anvi'o will try
                        to deal with missing data nicely. Each column in this
                        file will be visualized as a new layer in the tree.
```



**GENE MODE:**   Gene mode related parameters.

```
  --gene-mode           Initiate the interactive interface in "gene mode". In
                        this mode, the items are genes (instead of splits of
                        contigs). The following views are avilable: detection
                        (the detection value of each gene in each sample). The
                        mean_coverage (the mean coverage of genes). The
                        non_outlier_mean_coverage (the mean coverage of the
                        non-outlier nucleotide positions of each gene in each
                        sample (median absolute deviation is used to remove
                        outliers per gene per sample)). The
                        non_outlier_coverage_std view (standrad deviation of
                        the coverage of non-outlier positions of genes in
                        samples). You can also choose to order items and
                        layers according to each one of the aforementioned
                        views. In addition, all layer ordering that are
                        avialable in the regular mode (i.e. the full mode
                        where you have contigs/splits) are also available in
                        "gene mode", so that, for example, you can choose to
                        order the layers according to "detection", and that
                        would be the order according to the detection values
                        of splits, whereas if you choose "genes_detections"
                        then the order of layers would be according to the
                        detection values of genes. Inspection and sequence
                        functionality are available (through the right-click
                        menu), except now sequences are of the specific gene.
                        Inspection has now two options available: "Inspect
                        Context", which brings you to the inspection page of
                        the split to which the gene belongs where the
                        inspected gene will be highlighted in yellow in the
                        bottom, and "Inspect Gene", whih opens the inspection
                        page only for the gene and 100 nts around each side of
                        it (the purpose of this option is to make the
                        inspection page load faster if you only want to look
                        at the nucleotide coverage of a specific gene).
                        NOTICE: You can't store states or collections in "gene
                        mode". However, you still can make fake selections,
                        and create fake bins for your viewing covenience only
                        (smiley). Search options are available, and you can
                        even search for functions if you have them in your
                        contigs database. ANOTHER NOTICE: loading this mode
                        might take a while if your bin has many genes, and
                        your profile database has many samples, this is
                        beacause the gene coverages stats are computed in an
                        ad-hoc manner when you load this mode, we know this is
                        not ideal and we plan to improve that (along with
                        other things). If you have suggestions/complaints
                        regarding this mode please comment on this github
                        issue: https://goo.gl/yHhRei. Please refer to the
                        online tutorial for more information.
  -b BIN_NAME, --bin-id BIN_NAME
                        Bin name you are interested in.

**VISUALS RELATED:**   Parameters that give access to various adjustements regarding the
  interface.

```
  --view NAME           Start the interface with a pre-selected view. To see a
                        list of available views, use --show-views flag.
  --title NAME          Title for the interface. If you are working with a
                        RUNINFO dict, the title will be determined based on
                        information stored in that file. Regardless, you can
                        override that value using this parameter. If you are
                        not using a anvio RUNINFO dictionary, a meaningful
                        title will appear in the interface only if you define
                        one using this parameter.
  --taxonomic-level {t_phylum,t_class,t_order,t_family,t_genus,t_species}
                        The taxonomic level to use. The default is 't_genus'.
                        Only relevant if the anvi'o ontigs database contains
                        taxonomic annotations.
  --split-hmm-layers    When declared, this flag tells the interface to split
                        every gene found in HMM searches that were performed
                        against non-singlecopy gene HMM profiles into their
                        own layer. Please see the documentation for details.
  --hide-outlier-SNVs   During profiling, anvi'o marks positions of single-
                        nucleotide variations (SNVs) that originate from
                        places in contigs where coverage values are a bit
                        'sketchy'. If you would like to avoid SNVs in those
                        positions of splits in applicable projects you can use
                        this flag, and the interafce would hide SNVs that are
                        marked as 'outlier' (although it is clearly the best
                        to see everything, no one will judge you if you end up
                        using this flag) (plus, there may or may not be some
                        historical data on this here:
                        https://github.com/meren/anvio/issues/309).
  --state-autoload NAME
                        Automatically load previous saved state and draw tree.
                        To see a list of available states, use --show-states
                        flag.
  --collection-autoload NAME
                        Automatically load a collection and draw tree. To see
                        a list of available collections, use --list-
                        collections flag.
  --export-svg FILE_PATH
                        The SVG output file path.
```



**SWEET PARAMS OF CONVENIENCE:**   Parameters and flags that are not quite essential (but nice to have).

```
  --show-views          When declared, the program will show a list of
                        available views, and exit.
  --skip-check-names    For debugging purposes. You should never really need
                        it.
  -o DIR_PATH, --output-dir DIR_PATH
                        Directory path for output files
  --dry-run             Don't do anything real. Test everything, and stop
                        right before wherever the developer said 'well, this
                        is enough testing', and decided to print out results.
  --show-states         When declared the program will print all available
                        states and exit.
  --list-collections    Show available collections and exit.
  --skip-init-functions
                        When declared, function calls for genes will not be
                        initialized (therefore will be missing from all
                        relevant interfaces or output files). The use of this
                        flag may reduce the memory fingerprint and processing
                        time for large datasets.
  --skip-auto-ordering  When declared, the attempt to include automatically
                        generated orders of items based on additional data is
                        skipped. In case those buggers cause issues with your
                        data, and you still want to see your stuff and deal
                        with the other issue maybe later.
  --distance DISTANCE_METRIC
                        The distance metric for the hierarchical clustering.
                        Only relevant if you are running the interactive
                        interface in "collection" mode. The default is
                        "euclidean".
  --linkage LINKAGE_METHOD
                        The linkage method for the hierarchical clustering.
                        Only relevant if you are running the interactive
                        interface in "collection" mode. The default is "ward".
```



**SERVER CONFIGURATION:**   For power users.

```
  -I IP_ADDR, --ip-address IP_ADDR
                        IP address for the HTTP server. The default ip address
                        (0.0.0.0) should work just fine for most.
  -P INT, --port-number INT
                        Port number to use for anvi'o services. If nothing is
                        declared, anvi'o will try to find a suitable port
                        number, starting from the default port number, 8080.
  --browser-path PATH   By default, anvi'o will use your default browser to
                        launch the interactive interface. If you would like to
                        use something else than your system default, you can
                        provide a full path for an alternative browser using
                        this parameter, and hope for the best. For instance we
                        are using this parameter to call Google's experimental
                        browser, Canary, which performs better with demanding
                        visualizations.
  --read-only           When the interactive interface is started with this
                        flag, all 'database write' operations will be
                        disabled.
  --server-only         The default behavior is to start the local server, and
                        fire up a browser that connects to the server. If you
                        have other plans, and want to start the server without
                        calling the browser, this is the flag you need.
  --password-protected  If this flag is set, command line tool will ask you to
                        enter a password and interactive interface will be
                        only accessible after entering same password. This
                        option is recommended for shared machines like
                        clusters or shared networks where computers are not
                        isolated.

## anvi-matrix-to-newick

Takes an observation matrix, returns a newick tree.





**Usage**

```
anvi-matrix-to-newick [-h] [-o FILE_PATH] [--transpose]
                      [--distance DISTANCE_METRIC]
                      [--linkage LINKAGE_METHOD]
                      PATH
```

**Parameters**



**positional arguments:** 

```
  PATH                  Input matrix
```



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -o FILE_PATH, --output-file FILE_PATH
                        File path to store results.
  --transpose           Transpose the input matrix file before clustering.
  --distance DISTANCE_METRIC
                        The distance metric for the hierarchical clustering.
                        The default distance metric is 'euclidean'. You can
                        find the full list of distance metrics either by
                        making a mistake (such as entering a non-existent
                        distance metric and making anvi'o upset), or by taking
                        a look at the help menu of the
                        hierarchy.distance.pdist function in the scipy.cluster
                        module.
  --linkage LINKAGE_METHOD
                        The linkage method for the hierarchical clustering.
                        The default linkage method is 'ward', because that is
                        the best one. It really is. We talked to a lot of
                        people and they were all like 'this is the best one
                        available' and it is just all out there. Honestly it
                        is so good that we will build a wall around it and
                        make other linkage methods pay for it. But if you want
                        to see a full list of available ones you can check the
                        hierarcy.linkage function in the scipy.cluster module.
                        Up tp you really. But then you can't use ward anymore,
                        and you would have to leave anvi'o right now.
```





## anvi-mcg-classifier

A program to classify genes according to coverage across multiple metagenomes





**Usage**

```
anvi-mcg-classifier [-h] -p PROFILE_DB -c CONTIGS_DB
                    [-O FILENAME_PREFIX] [-C COLLECTION_NAME]
                    [-b BIN_NAME] [-B FILE_PATH]
                    [--exclude-samples FILE] [--include-samples FILE]
                    [--gen-figures] [--get-samples-stats-only] [-W]
                    [--alpha NUM] [--outliers-threshold NUM]
                    [--zeros-are-outliers]
```

**Parameters**



**ESSENTIAL INPUTS:**   You must supply a merged profile db (along with a matching contigs db)

```
  -p PROFILE_DB, --profile-db PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o profile database
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
```



**ESSENTIAL OUTPUTS:**   The outputs of the algorithm are: an anvio additional layers format file
  with the classification information for genes. An anvio samples
  information file with detectino information per sample. In addition, when
  a profile database is given then a gene-coverages, and gene-detection
  tables would also be saved. All files are created with the prefix that is
  provided by the user.

```
  -O FILENAME_PREFIX, --output-file-prefix FILENAME_PREFIX
                        A prefix to be used while naming the output files (no
                        file type extensions please; just a prefix).
  -C COLLECTION_NAME, --collection-name COLLECTION_NAME
                        Collection name.
```



**ADDITIONAL STUFF:**   Parameters to provide pre-existing additional layers, samples-information
  files, so that the outputs would be added to these files

```
  -b BIN_NAME, --bin-id BIN_NAME
                        Bin name you are interested in.
  -B FILE_PATH, --bin-ids-file FILE_PATH
                        Text file for bins (each line should be a unique bin
                        id).
  --exclude-samples FILE
                        List of samples to exclude for the analysis.
  --include-samples FILE
                        List of samples to include for the analysis.
  --gen-figures         For those of you who wish to dig deeper, a collection
                        of figures could be created to allow you to get
                        insight into how the classification was generated.
                        This is especially useful to identify cases in which
                        you shouldn't trust the classification (for example
                        due to a large number of outliers). NOTICE: if you ask
                        anvi'o to generate these figures then it will
                        significantly extend the execution time. To learn
                        about which figures are created and what they mean,
                        contact your nearest anvi'o developer, because
                        currently it is a well-hidden secret.
  --get-samples-stats-only
                        If you only wish to get statistics regarding the
                        occurence of bins in samples, then use this flag.
                        Especially when dealing with many samples or large
                        genomes, gene stats could be a long time to compute.
                        By using this flag you could save a lot of computation
                        time.
  -W, --overwrite-output-destinations
                        Overwrite if the output files and/or directories
                        exist.
```



**PARAMETERS:**   Parameters to determine cut-offs for the gene-classifier

```
  --alpha NUM, --genome-detection-uncertainty NUM
                        Determines the range of sample detection values that
                        are considered negative, ambiguous or positive. Min of
                        0 and smaller than 0.5, default of 0.25. For exmaple
                        for the default samples with detection below 0.5-0.25
                        = 0.25 will be considered negative (i.e. donot contain
                        the genome), samples with detection between 0.25 and
                        0.75 would be ambiguous (and hence would not be used
                        for the classification), and samples with detection
                        above 0.75 would be considered positive (i.e. contain
                        the genome).
  --outliers-threshold NUM
                        Threshold to use for the outlier detection. The
                        default value is '1.5'. Absolute deviation around the
                        median is used. To read more about the method please
                        refer to: 'How to Detect and Handle Outliers' by Boris
                        Iglewicz and David Hoaglin
                        (doi:10.1016/j.jesp.2013.03.013).
  --zeros-are-outliers  If you want all zero coverage positions to be treated
                        like outliers then use this flag. The reason to treat
                        zero coverage as outliers is because when mapping
                        reads to a reference we could get many zero positions
                        due to accessory genes. These positions then skew the
                        average values that we compute.

## anvi-merge

Merge multiple anvio profiles





**Usage**

```
anvi-merge [-h] -c CONTIGS_DB [-o DIR_PATH] [-S NAME]
           [--description TEXT_FILE] [--skip-hierarchical-clustering]
           [--enforce-hierarchical-clustering]
           [--distance DISTANCE_METRIC] [--linkage LINKAGE_METHOD]
           [--skip-concoct-binning] [-W]
           SINGLE_PROFILES) [SINGLE_PROFILE(S ...]
```

**Parameters**



**positional arguments:** 

```
  SINGLE_PROFILE(S)     Anvo'o single profiles to merge
```



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
  -o DIR_PATH, --output-dir DIR_PATH
                        Directory path for output files
  -S NAME, --sample-name NAME
                        It is important to set a sample name (using only ASCII
                        letters and digits and without spaces) that is unique
                        (considering all others). If you do not provide one,
                        anvi'o will try to make up one for you based on other
                        information, although, you should never let the
                        software to decide these things).
  --description TEXT_FILE
                        A plain text file that contains some description about
                        the project. You can use Markdwon syntax. The
                        description text will be rendered and shown in all
                        relevant interfaces, including the anvi'o interactive
                        interface, or anvi'o summary outputs.
  --skip-hierarchical-clustering
                        If you are not planning to use the interactive
                        interface (or if you have other means to add a tree of
                        contigs in the database) you may skip the step where
                        hierarchical clustering of your items are preformed
                        based on default clustering recipes matching to your
                        database type.
  --enforce-hierarchical-clustering
                        If you have more than 25,000 splits in your merged
                        profile, anvi-merge will automatically skip the
                        hierarchical clustering of splits (by setting --skip-
                        hierarchical-clustering flag on). This is due to the
                        fact that computational time required for hierarchical
                        clustering increases exponentially with the number of
                        items being clustered. Based on our experience we
                        decided that 25,000 splits is about the maximum we
                        should try. However, this is not a theoretical limit,
                        and you can overwrite this heuristic by using this
                        flag, which would tell anvi'o to attempt to cluster
                        splits regardless.
  --distance DISTANCE_METRIC
                        The distance metric for the hierarchical clustering.
                        If you do not use this flag, the default distance
                        metric will be used for each clustering configuration
                        which is "euclidean".
  --linkage LINKAGE_METHOD
                        The same story with the `--distance`, except, the
                        system default for this one is ward.
  --skip-concoct-binning
                        Anvi'o uses CONCOCT (Alneberg et al.) by default for
                        unsupervised genome binning for merged runs. CONCOCT
                        results are stored in the profile database, which then
                        can be used from within appropriate interfaces (i.e.,
                        anvi-interactive, anvi-summary, etc). Use this flag if
                        you would like to skip this step
  -W, --overwrite-output-destinations
                        Overwrite if the output files and/or directories
                        exist.
```





## anvi-merge-bins

Merge a given set of bins in an anvi&#39;o collection





**Usage**

```
anvi-merge-bins [-h] -p PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB [-C COLLECTION_NAME]
                [-b BIN NAMES] [-B BIN NAME] [--list-collections]
                [--list-bins]
```

**Parameters**



**DB AND COLLECTION:**   Simple enough. This guy needs a pan or profile database and a collection
  name. You can get a list of available collections with another flag down
  below.

```
  -p PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB, --pan-or-profile-db PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o pan or profile database (and even genes
                        database in appropriate contexts).
  -C COLLECTION_NAME, --collection-name COLLECTION_NAME
                        Collection name.
```



**BINS TO WORK WITH:**   Here you need to define a list of bin names to merge, and the new bin name
  for them to merge under. Your bin names should be comma-separated. Both
  &#39;name_1, name_2, name_3&#39; and name_1,name_2,name_3 will work. Your new bin
  name better be a single word, meaningful name so anvi&#39;o does not complain
  about it later.

```
  -b BIN NAMES, --bin-names-list BIN NAMES
                        Comma-separated list of bin names.
  -B BIN NAME, --new-bin-name BIN NAME
                        The new bin name.
```



**SWEET FLAGS OF CONVENIENCE:**   We gotchu.

```
  --list-collections    Show available collections and exit.
  --list-bins           List available bins in a collection and exit.
```





## anvi-meta-pan-genome

Convert a pangenome into a metapangenome.





**Usage**

```
anvi-meta-pan-genome [-h] -p PAN_DB [-g GENOMES_STORAGE] [-i FILE]
                     [--fraction-of-median-coverage FLOAT]
                     [--min-detection FLOAT]
```

**Parameters**



**PANGENOME:**   Files for the pangenome.

```
  -p PAN_DB, --pan-db PAN_DB
                        Anvi'o pan database
  -g GENOMES_STORAGE, --genomes-storage GENOMES_STORAGE
                        Anvi'o genomes storage file
```



**METAGENOME:**   Genome bins stored in an anvi&#39;o profile databases as collections.

```
  -i FILE, --internal-genomes FILE
                        A four-column TAB-delimited flat text file. This file
                        should be identical to the internal genomes file you
                        used for your pangenomics analysis. Anvi'o will use
                        this file to find all profile and contigs databases
                        that contain the information for each gene and genome
                        across metagenomes.
```



**CRITERION FOR DETECTION:**   This is tricky. What we want to do is to identify genes that are occurring
  uniformly across samples.

```
  --fraction-of-median-coverage FLOAT
                        The value set here will be used to remove a gene if
                        its total coverage across environments is less than
                        the median coverage of all genes multiplied by this
                        value. The default is 0.25, which means, if the median
                        total coverage of all genes across all samples is
                        100X, then, a gene with a total coverage of less than
                        25X across all samples will be assumed not a part of
                        the 'environmental core'.
  --min-detection FLOAT
                        For this entire thing to work, the genome you are
                        focusing on should be detected in at least one
                        metagenome. If that is not the case, it would mean
                        that you do not have any sample that represents the
                        niche for this organism (or you do not have enough
                        depth of coverage) to investigate the detection of
                        genes in the environment. By default, this script
                        requires at least '0.5' of the genome to be detected
                        in at least one metagenome. This parameter allows you
                        to change that. 0 would mean no detection test
                        required, 1 would mean the entire genome must be
                        detected.
```

                        Anvi'o will stop upgrading your database when it
                        reaches to this version.
```

```





## anvi-pan-genome

A DIAMOND and MCL-based anvi&#39;o pangenome workflow. You provide genomes from
anywhere (whether they are external genomes, or anvi&#39;o genome bins in
collections), and it gives you back a pangenome analysis.





**Usage**

```
anvi-pan-genome [-h] -g GENOMES_STORAGE [-G GENOME_NAMES]
                [--skip-alignments] [--skip-homogeneity]
                [--quick-homogeneity] [--align-with ALIGNER]
                [--exclude-partial-gene-calls] [--use-ncbi-blast]

                [--min-occurrence NUM_OCCURRENCE]
                [--min-percent-identity PERCENT] [--sensitive]
                [-n PROJECT_NAME] [--description TEXT_FILE]
                [-o DIR_PATH] [-W] [-T NUM_THREADS]
                [--skip-hierarchical-clustering]
                [--enforce-hierarchical-clustering]
                [--distance DISTANCE_METRIC] [--linkage LINKAGE_METHOD]
```

**Parameters**



**GENOMES:**   The very fancy genomes storage file. This file is generated by the program
  `anvi-genomes-storage`. Please see the online tutorial on pangenomic
  workflow if you don&#39;t know how to generate one.

```
  -g GENOMES_STORAGE, --genomes-storage GENOMES_STORAGE
                        Anvi'o genomes storage file
  -G GENOME_NAMES, --genome-names GENOME_NAMES
                        Genome names to 'focus'. You can use this parameter to
                        limit the genomes included in your analysis. You can
                        provide these names as a commma-separated list of
                        names, or you can put them in a file, where you have a
                        single genome name in each line, and provide the file
                        path.
```



**PARAMETERS:**   Important stuff Tom never pays attention (but you should).

```
  --skip-alignments     By default, anvi'o attempts to align amino acid
                        sequences in each gene cluster using multiple sequnce
                        alignment via muscle. You can use this flag to skip
                        that step and be upset later.
  --skip-homogeneity    By default, anvi'o attempts to calculate homogeneity
                        values for every gene cluster, given that they are
                        aligned. You can use this flag to have anvi'o skip
                        homogeneity calculations. Anvi'o will ignore this flag
                        if you decide to skip alignments
  --quick-homogeneity   By default, anvi'o will use a homogeneity algorithm
                        that checks for horizontal and vertical geometric
                        homogeneity (along with functional). With this flag,
                        you can tell anvi'o to skip horizontal geometric
                        homogeneity calculations. It will be less accurate but
                        quicker. Anvi'o will ignore this flag if you skip
                        homogeneity calculations or alignments all together.
  --align-with ALIGNER  The multiple sequnce alignment program to use when
                        multiple seqeunce alignment is necessary. To see all
                        available optons, use the flag `--list-aligners`.
  --exclude-partial-gene-calls
                        By default, anvi'o includes all partial gene calls
                        from the analysis, which, in some cases, may inflate
                        the number of gene clusters identified and introduce
                        extra heterogeneity within those gene clusters. Using
                        this flag, you can request anvi'o to exclude partial
                        gene calls from the analysis (whether a gene call is
                        partial or not is an information that comes directly
                        from the gene caller used to identify genes during the
                        generation of the contigs database).
  --use-ncbi-blast      This program uses DIAMOND by default, however, if you
                        like, you can use good ol' blastp from NCBI instead.
  --minbit MINBIT       The minimum minbit value. The minbit heuristic
                        provides a mean to set a to eliminate weak matches
                        between two amino acid sequences. We learned it from
                        ITEP (Benedict MN et al, doi:10.1186/1471-2164-15-8),
                        which is a comprehensive analysis workflow for
                        pangenomes, and decided to use it in the anvi'o
                        pangenomic workflow, as well. Briefly, If you have two
                        amino acid sequences, 'A' and 'B', the minbit is
                        defined as 'BITSCORE(A, B) / MIN(BITSCORE(A, A),
                        BITSCORE(B, B))'. So the minbit score between two
                        sequences goes to 1 if they are very similar over the
                        entire length of the 'shorter' amino acid sequence,
                        and goes to 0 if (1) they match over a very short
                        stretch compared even to the length of the shorter
                        amino acid sequence or (2) the match betwen sequence
                        identity is low. The default is 0.5.
  --mcl-inflation INFLATION
                        MCL inflation parameter, that defines the sensitivity
                        of the algorithm during the identification of the gene
                        clusters. More information on this parameter and it's
                        effect on cluster granularity is here:
                        (http://micans.org/mcl/man/mclfaq.html#faq7.2). The
                        default is 2.
  --min-occurrence NUM_OCCURRENCE
                        Do you not want singletons?\ You don't? Well, this
                        parameter will help you get rid of them (along with
                        doubletons, if you want). Anvi'o will remove gene
                        clusters that occur less than the number you set using
                        this parameter from the analysis. The default is 1,
                        which means everything will be kept. If you want to
                        remove singletons, set it to 2, if you want to remove
                        doubletons as well, set it to 3, and so on.
  --min-percent-identity PERCENT
                        Minimum percent identity between the two amino acid
                        sequences for them to have an edge for MCL analysis.
                        This value will be used to filter hits from Diamond
                        search results. Because percent identity is not a
                        predictor of a good match (since it does not
                        communicate many other important factors such as the
                        alignment length between the two sequences and its
                        proportion to the entire length of those involved), we
                        suggest you rely on 'minbit' parameter. But you know
                        what? Maybe you shouldn't listen to anyone, and
                        experiment on your own! The default is 0 percent.
  --sensitive           DIAMOND sensitivity. With this flag you can instruct
                        DIAMOND to be 'sensitive', rather than 'fast' during
                        the search. It is likely the search will take
                        remarkably longer. But, hey, if you are doing it for
                        your final analysis, maybe it should take longer and
                        be more accurate. This flag is only relevant if you
                        are running DIAMOND.
```



**OTHERS:**   Sweet parameters of convenience.

```
  -n PROJECT_NAME, --project-name PROJECT_NAME
                        Name of the project. Please choose a short but
                        descriptive name (so anvi'o can use it whenever she
                        needs to name an output file, or add a new table in a
                        database, or name her first born).
  --description TEXT_FILE
                        A plain text file that contains some description about
                        the project. You can use Markdwon syntax. The
                        description text will be rendered and shown in all
                        relevant interfaces, including the anvi'o interactive
                        interface, or anvi'o summary outputs.
  -o DIR_PATH, --output-dir DIR_PATH
                        Directory path for output files
  -W, --overwrite-output-destinations
                        Overwrite if the output files and/or directories
                        exist.
  -T NUM_THREADS, --num-threads NUM_THREADS
                        Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading
                        whenever possible. Very conservatively, the default is
                        1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number of CPUs
                        / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with
                        this option if you are running your commands on a SGE
                        --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking for
                        multiple threads to use, you may deplete your
                        resources very fast.

**ORGANIZING GENE CLUSTERs:**   These are stuff that will change the clustering dendrogram of your gene
  clusters.

```
  --skip-hierarchical-clustering
                        Anvi'o attempts to generate a hierarchical clustering
                        of your gene clusters once it identifies them so you
                        can use `anvi-display-pan` to play with it. But if you
                        want to skip this step, this is your flag.
  --enforce-hierarchical-clustering
                        If you want anvi'o to try to generate a hierarchical
                        clustering of your gene clusters even if the number of
                        gene clusters exceeds its suggested limit for
                        hierarchical clustering, you can use this flag to
                        enforce it. Are you are a rebel of some sorts? Or did
                        computers made you upset? Express your anger towards
                        machine using this flag.
  --distance DISTANCE_METRIC
                        The distance metric for the clustering of gene
                        clusters. If you do not use this flag, the default
                        distance metric will be used for each clustering
                        configuration which is "euclidean".
  --linkage LINKAGE_METHOD
                        The same story with the `--distance`, except, the
                        system default for this one is ward.

```

**Parameters**



**INPUTS:**   There are two possible inputs for anvio profiler. You must to declare
  either of these two.

```
  -i INPUT_BAM, --input-file INPUT_BAM
                        Sorted and indexed BAM file to analyze. Takes a long
                        time depending on the length of the file and
                        parameters used for profiling.
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
  --blank-profile       If you only have contig sequences, but no mapping data
                        (i.e., you found a genome and would like to take a
                        look from it), this flag will become very hand. After
                        creating a contigs database for your contigs, you can
                        create a blank anvi'o profile database to use anvi'o
                        interactive interface with that contigs database
                        without any mapping data.
```



**EXTRAS:**   Things that are not mandatory, but can be useful if/when declared.

```
  -o DIR_PATH, --output-dir DIR_PATH
                        Directory path for output files
  -W, --overwrite-output-destinations
                        Overwrite if the output files and/or directories
                        exist.
  -S NAME, --sample-name NAME
                        It is important to set a sample name (using only ASCII
                        letters and digits and without spaces) that is unique
                        (considering all others). If you do not provide one,
                        anvi'o will try to make up one for you based on other
                        information, although, you should never let the
                        software to decide these things).
  --report-variability-full
                        One of the things anvi-profile does is to store
                        information about variable nucleotide positions.
                        Usually it does not report every variable position,
                        since not every variable position is geniune
                        variation. Say, if you have 1,000 coverage, and all
                        nucleotides at that position are Ts and only one of
                        them is a C, the confidence of that C being a real
                        variation is quite low. anvio has a simple algorithm
                        in place to reduce the impact of noise. However, using
                        this flag you can diable it and ask profiler to report
                        every single variation (which may result in very large
                        output files and millions of reports, but you are the
                        boss). Do not forget to take a look at '--min-
                        coverage-for-variability' parameter
  --skip-SNV-profiling  By default, anvi'o characterizes single-nucleotide
                        variation in each sample. The use of this flag will
                        instruct profiler to skip that step. Please remember
                        that parameters and flags must be identical between
                        different profiles using the same contigs database for
                        them to merge properly.
  --profile-SCVs        Anvi'o can perform accurate characterization of codon
                        frequencies in genes during profiling. While having
                        codon frequencies opens doors to powerful evolutionary
                        insights in downstream analyses, due to its
                        computational complexity, this feature comes 'off' by
                        default. Using this flag you can rise against the
                        authority as you always should, and make anvi'o
                        profile codons.
  --description TEXT_FILE
                        A plain text file that contains some description about
                        the project. You can use Markdwon syntax. The
                        description text will be rendered and shown in all
                        relevant interfaces, including the anvi'o interactive
                        interface, or anvi'o summary outputs.
  --include-orphans     Include orphans (paired reads that are not in a proper
                        pair). The default is to ignore orphans.
```



**HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING:**   Do you want your splits to be clustered? Yes? No? Maybe? Remember: By
  default, anvi-profile will not perform hierarchical clustering on your
  splits; but if you use `--blank` flag, it will try. You can skip that by
  using the `--skip-hierarchical-clustering` flag.

```
  --cluster-contigs     Single profiles are rarely used for genome binning or
                        visualization, and since clustering step increases the
                        profiling runtime for no good reason, the default
                        behavior is to not cluster contigs for individual
                        runs. However, if you are planning to do binning on
                        one sample, you must use this flag to tell anvio to
                        run cluster configurations for single runs on your
                        sample.
  --skip-hierarchical-clustering
                        If you are not planning to use the interactive
                        interface (or if you have other means to add a tree of
                        contigs in the database) you may skip the step where
                        hierarchical clustering of your items are preformed
                        based on default clustering recipes matching to your
                        database type.
  --distance DISTANCE_METRIC
                        The distance metric for the hierarchical clustering.
                        Only relevant if you are using `--cluster-contigs`
                        flag. The default is "euclidean".
  --linkage LINKAGE_METHOD
                        The linkage method for the hierarchical clustering.
                        Just like the distance metric this is only relevant if
                        you are using it with `--cluster-contigs` flag. The
                        default is "ward".
```



**NUMBERS:**   Defaults of these parameters will impact your analysis. You can always
  come back to them and update your profiles, but it is important to make
  sure defaults are reasonable for your sample.

```
  -M INT, --min-contig-length INT
                        Minimum length of contigs in a BAM file to analyze.
                        The minimum length should be long enough for tetra-
                        nucleotide frequency analysis to be meaningful. There
                        is no way to define a golden number of minumum length
                        that would be applicable to genomes found in all
                        environments, but we chose the default to be 1000, and
                        have been happy with it. You are welcome to
                        experiment, but we advise to never go below 1,000. You
                        also should remember that the lower you go, the more
                        time it will take to analyze all contigs. You can use
                        --list-contigs parameter to have an idea how many
                        contigs would be discarded for a given M.
  --max-contig-length INT
                        Just like the minimum contig length parameter, but to
                        set a maximum. Basically this will remove any contig
                        longer than a certain value. Why would anyone need
                        this? Who knows. But if you ever do, it is here.
  -X INT, --min-mean-coverage INT
                        Minimum mean coverage for contigs to be kept in the
                        analysis. The default value is 0, which is for your
                        best interest if you are going to profile muptiple BAM
                        files which are then going to be merged for a cross-
                        sectional or time series analysis. Do not change it if
                        you are not sure this is what you want to do.
  -V INT, --min-coverage-for-variability INT
                        Minimum coverage of a nucleotide position to be
                        subjected to SNV profiling. By default, anvio will not
                        attempt to make sense of variation in a given
                        nucleotide position if it is covered less than 10X.
                        You can change that minimum using this parameter.
```



**CONTIGS:**   Sweet parameters of convenience

```
  --list-contigs        When declared, the program will list contigs in the
                        BAM file and exit gracefully without any further
                        analysis.
  --contigs-of-interest FILE
                        It is possible to analyze only a group of contigs from
                        a given BAM file. If you provide a text file, in which
                        every contig of interest is listed line by line, the
                        profiler would engine only on those contigs in the BAM
                        file and ignore the rest. This can be used for
                        debugging purposes, or to engine on a particular group
                        of contigs that were identified as relevant during the
                        interactive analysis.
```



**PERFORMANCE:**   Performance settings for profiler

```
  -T NUM_THREADS, --num-threads NUM_THREADS
                        Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading
                        whenever possible. Very conservatively, the default is
                        1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number of CPUs
                        / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with
                        this option if you are running your commands on a SGE
                        --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking for
                        multiple threads to use, you may deplete your
                        resources very fast.
  --queue-size INT      The queue size for worker threads to store data to
                        communicate to the main thread. The default is set by
                        the class based on the number of threads. If you have
                        *any* hesitation about whther you know what you are
                        doing, you should not change this value.
  --write-buffer-size INT
                        How many items should be kept in memory before they
                        are written do the disk. The default is 500. The
                        larger the buffer size, the less frequent the program
                        will access to the disk, yet the more memory will be
                        consumed since the processed items will be cleared off
                        the memory only after they are written to the disk.
                        The default buffer size will likely work for most
                        cases, but if you have very large contigs, you may
                        need to decrease this value. Please keep an eye on the
                        memory usage output to make sure the memory use never
                        exceeds the size of the physical memory.
```





## anvi-push

Push stuff to an anvi&#39;server





**Usage**

```
anvi-push [-h] --user USERNAME [--api-url API_URL] -n PROJECT_NAME
          [-t NEWICK] [--items-order FLAT_FILE] [-f FASTA]
          [-d VIEW_DATA] [-A ADDITIONAL_LAYERS] [-s STATE]
          [--description TEXT_FILE] [--bins BINS_DATA]
          [--bins-info BINS_INFO] [--delete-if-exists]
```

**Parameters**



**SERVER DETAILS:**   Details of how to access to an anvi&#39;server instance.

```
  --user USERNAME       The user for an anvi'server.
  --api-url API_URL     Anvi'server url
```



**PROJECT DETAILS:**   What to send to the server

```
  -n PROJECT_NAME, --project-name PROJECT_NAME
                        Name of the project. Please choose a short but
                        descriptive name (so anvi'o can use it whenever she
                        needs to name an output file, or add a new table in a
                        database, or name her first born).
  -t NEWICK, --tree NEWICK
                        NEWICK formatted tree structure
  --items-order FLAT_FILE
                        A flat file that contains the order of items you wish
                        the display using the interactive interface. You may
                        want to use this if you have a specific order of items
                        in your mind, and do not want to display a tree in the
                        middle (or simply you don't have one). The file format
                        is simple: each line should have an item name, and
                        there should be no header.
  -f FASTA, --fasta-file FASTA
                        A FASTA-formatted input file
  -d VIEW_DATA, --view-data VIEW_DATA
                        A TAB-delimited file for view data
  -A ADDITIONAL_LAYERS, --additional-layers ADDITIONAL_LAYERS
                        A TAB-delimited file for additional layers for splits.
                        The first column of this file must be split names, and
                        the remaining columns should be unique attributes. The
                        file does not need to contain all split names, or
                        values for each split in every column. Anvi'o will try
                        to deal with missing data nicely. Each column in this
                        file will be visualized as a new layer in the tree.
  -s STATE, --state STATE
                        State file, you can export states from database using
                        anvi-export-state program
  --description TEXT_FILE
                        A plain text file that contains some description about
                        the project. You can use Markdwon syntax. The
                        description text will be rendered and shown in all
                        relevant interfaces, including the anvi'o interactive
                        interface, or anvi'o summary outputs.
  --bins BINS_DATA      Tab-delimited file, first column contains tree leaves
                        (gene clusters, splits, contigs etc.) and second
                        column contains which Bin they belong.
  --bins-info BINS_INFO
                        Additional information for bins. The file must contain
                        three TAB-delimited columns, where the first one must
                        be a unique bin name, the second should be a 'source',
                        and the last one should be a 7 character HTML color
                        code (i.e., '#424242'). Source column must contain
                        information about the origin of the bin. If these bins
                        are automatically identified by a program like
                        CONCOCT, this column could contain the program name
                        and version. The source information will be associated
                        with the bin in various interfaces so in a sense it is
                        not *that* critical what it says there, but on the
                        other hand it is, becuse we should also think about
                        people who may end up having to work with what we put
                        together later.
```



**RISKY CLICKS:**   As the name suggests!

```
  --delete-if-exists    Be bold (at your own risk), and delete if exists.
```





## anvi-refine

Start the anvi&#39;o interactive interactive for refining





**Usage**

```
anvi-refine [-h] -p PROFILE_DB -c CONTIGS_DB [-C COLLECTION_NAME]
            [-b BIN_NAME] [-B FILE_PATH] [--load-full-state]
            [-V ADDITIONAL_VIEW] [-A ADDITIONAL_LAYERS]
            [--split-hmm-layers]
            [--taxonomic-level {t_phylum,t_class,t_order,t_family,t_genus,t_species}]
            [--hide-outlier-SNVs] [--title NAME]
            [--export-svg FILE_PATH] [--dry-run]
            [--skip-init-functions] [--skip-auto-ordering] [-I IP_ADDR]
            [-P INT] [--browser-path PATH] [--read-only]
            [--server-only] [--password-protected]
```

**Parameters**



**DEFAULT INPUTS:**   The interavtive interface can be started with and without anvi&#39;o
  databases. The default use assumes you have your profile and contigs
  database, however, it is also possible to start the interface using ad-hoc
  input files. See &#39;MANUAL INPUT&#39; section for other set of parameters that
  are mutually exclusive with datanases.

```
  -p PROFILE_DB, --profile-db PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o profile database
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
```



**REFINE-SPECIFICS:**   Parameters that are essential to the refinement process.

```
  -C COLLECTION_NAME, --collection-name COLLECTION_NAME
                        Collection name.
  -b BIN_NAME, --bin-id BIN_NAME
                        Bin name you are interested in.
  -B FILE_PATH, --bin-ids-file FILE_PATH
                        Text file for bins (each line should be a unique bin
                        id).
```



**ADDITIONAL STUFF:**   Parameters to provide additional layers, views, or layer data.

```
  --load-full-state     Often the minimum and maximum values defined for the
                        an entire profile database that contains all contigs
                        do not scale well when you wish to work with a single
                        bin in the refine mode. For this reason, the default
                        behavior of anvi-refine is to ignore min/max values
                        set in the default state. This flag is your way of
                        telling anvi'o to not do that, and load the state
                        stored in the profile database as is.
  -V ADDITIONAL_VIEW, --additional-view ADDITIONAL_VIEW
                        A TAB-delimited file for an additional view to be used
                        in the interface. This file file should contain all
                        split names, and values for each of them in all
                        samples. Each column in this file must correspond to a
                        sample name. Content of this file will be called
                        'user_view', which will be available as a new item in
                        the 'views' combo box in the interface
  -A ADDITIONAL_LAYERS, --additional-layers ADDITIONAL_LAYERS
                        A TAB-delimited file for additional layers for splits.
                        The first column of this file must be split names, and
                        the remaining columns should be unique attributes. The
                        file does not need to contain all split names, or
                        values for each split in every column. Anvi'o will try
                        to deal with missing data nicely. Each column in this
                        file will be visualized as a new layer in the tree.
```



**VISUALS RELATED:**   Parameters that give access to various adjustements regarding the
  interface.

```
  --split-hmm-layers    When declared, this flag tells the interface to split
                        every gene found in HMM searches that were performed
                        against non-singlecopy gene HMM profiles into their
                        own layer. Please see the documentation for details.
  --taxonomic-level {t_phylum,t_class,t_order,t_family,t_genus,t_species}
                        The taxonomic level to use. The default is 't_genus'.
                        Only relevant if the anvi'o ontigs database contains
                        taxonomic annotations.
  --hide-outlier-SNVs   During profiling, anvi'o marks positions of single-
                        nucleotide variations (SNVs) that originate from
                        places in contigs where coverage values are a bit
                        'sketchy'. If you would like to avoid SNVs in those
                        positions of splits in applicable projects you can use
                        this flag, and the interafce would hide SNVs that are
                        marked as 'outlier' (although it is clearly the best
                        to see everything, no one will judge you if you end up
                        using this flag) (plus, there may or may not be some
                        historical data on this here:
                        https://github.com/meren/anvio/issues/309).
  --title NAME          Title for the interface. If you are working with a
                        RUNINFO dict, the title will be determined based on
                        information stored in that file. Regardless, you can
                        override that value using this parameter. If you are
                        not using a anvio RUNINFO dictionary, a meaningful
                        title will appear in the interface only if you define
                        one using this parameter.
  --export-svg FILE_PATH
                        The SVG output file path.
```



**SWEET PARAMS OF CONVENIENCE:**   Parameters and flags that are not quite essential (but nice to have).

```
  --dry-run             Don't do anything real. Test everything, and stop
                        right before wherever the developer said 'well, this
                        is enough testing', and decided to print out results.
  --skip-init-functions
                        When declared, function calls for genes will not be
                        initialized (therefore will be missing from all
                        relevant interfaces or output files). The use of this
                        flag may reduce the memory fingerprint and processing
                        time for large datasets.
  --skip-auto-ordering  When declared, the attempt to include automatically
                        generated orders of items based on additional data is
                        skipped. In case those buggers cause issues with your
                        data, and you still want to see your stuff and deal
                        with the other issue maybe later.
```



**SERVER CONFIGURATION:**   For power users.

```
  -I IP_ADDR, --ip-address IP_ADDR
                        IP address for the HTTP server. The default ip address
                        (0.0.0.0) should work just fine for most.
  -P INT, --port-number INT
                        Port number to use for anvi'o services. If nothing is
                        declared, anvi'o will try to find a suitable port
                        number, starting from the default port number, 8080.
  --browser-path PATH   By default, anvi'o will use your default browser to
                        launch the interactive interface. If you would like to
                        use something else than your system default, you can
                        provide a full path for an alternative browser using
                        this parameter, and hope for the best. For instance we
                        are using this parameter to call Google's experimental
                        browser, Canary, which performs better with demanding
                        visualizations.
  --read-only           When the interactive interface is started with this
                        flag, all 'database write' operations will be
                        disabled.
  --server-only         The default behavior is to start the local server, and
                        fire up a browser that connects to the server. If you
                        have other plans, and want to start the server without
                        calling the browser, this is the flag you need.
  --password-protected  If this flag is set, command line tool will ask you to
                        enter a password and interactive interface will be
                        only accessible after entering same password. This
                        option is recommended for shared machines like
                        clusters or shared networks where computers are not
                        isolated.
```





## anvi-rename-bins

Rename all bins in a given collection (so they have pretty names).





**Usage**

```
anvi-rename-bins [-h] -c CONTIGS_DB -p PROFILE_DB
                 [--collection-to-read COLLECTION_TO_READ]
                 [--collection-to-write COLLECTION_TO_WRITE]
                 [--prefix PREFIX] [--report-file REPORT_FILE_PATH]
                 [--list-collections] [--dry-run] [--call-MAGs]
                 [--min-completion-for-MAG [0-100]]
                 [--max-redundancy-for-MAG [0-100]]
                 [--size-for-MAG MEGABASEPAIRS]
```

**Parameters**



**DEFAULT INPUTS:**   Standard stuff

```
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
  -p PROFILE_DB, --profile-db PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o profile database
  --collection-to-read COLLECTION_TO_READ
                        Collection name to read from. Anvi'o will not
                        overwrite an existing collection, instead, it will
                        create a copy of your collection with new bin names.
  --collection-to-write COLLECTION_TO_WRITE
                        The new collection name. Give it a nice, fancy name.
```



**OUTPUT AND TESTING:**   a.k.a, sweet parameters of convenience

```
  --prefix PREFIX       Prefix for the bin names. Must be a single word,
                        composed of digits and numbers. The use of the
                        underscore character is OK, but that's about it (fine,
                        the use of the dash character is OK, too but no
                        more!). If the prefix is 'PREFIX', each bin will be
                        renamed as 'PREFIX_XXX_00001, PREFIX_XXX_00002', and
                        so on, in the order of percent completion minus
                        percent redundancy (what we call, 'substantive
                        completion'). The 'XXX' part will either be 'Bin', or
                        'MAG depending on other parameters you use. Keep
                        reading.
  --report-file REPORT_FILE_PATH
                        This file will report each name change event, so you
                        can trace back the original names of renamed bins
                        later.
  --list-collections    Show available collections and exit.
  --dry-run             When used does NOT update the profile database, just
                        creates the report file so you can view how things
                        will be renamed.
```



**MAG OPTIONS:**   If you want to call some bins &#39;MAGs&#39; because you are so cool

```
  --call-MAGs           This program by default rename your bins as
                        'PREFIX_Bin_00001', 'PREFIX_Bin_00002' and so on. If
                        you use this flag, it will name the ones that meet the
                        criteria described by MAG-related flags as
                        'PREFIX_MAG_00001', 'PREFIX_MAG_00002', and so on. The
                        ones that do not get to be named as MAGs will remain
                        as bins.
  --min-completion-for-MAG [0-100]
                        If --call-MAGs flag is used, call any bin a 'MAG' if
                        their completion estimate is above this (the default
                        is 70), and the redundancy estimate is less than
                        --max-redundancy-for-MAG.
  --max-redundancy-for-MAG [0-100]
                        If --call-MAGs flag is used, call any bin a 'MAG' if
                        their redundancy estimate is below this (the default
                        is 10) and the completion estimate is above --min-
                        completion-for-MAG.
  --size-for-MAG MEGABASEPAIRS
                        If --call-MAGs flag is used, call any bin a 'MAG' if
                        their redundancy estimate is less than --max-
                        redundancy-for-MAG, AND THEIR SIZE IS LARGER THAN THIS
                        VALUE REGARDLESS OF THE COMPLETION ESTIMATE. The
                        default behavior is to not care about this at all.
```





## anvi-report-linkmers

Access reads in contigs and positions in a BAM file





**Usage**

```
anvi-report-linkmers [-h] -i INPUT_BAMS) [INPUT_BAM(S ...]
                     --contigs-and-positions CONTIGS_AND_POS
                     [--only-complete-links] -o FILE_PATH
                     [--list-contigs]
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -i INPUT_BAM(S) [INPUT_BAM(S) ...], --input-files INPUT_BAM(S) [INPUT_BAM(S) ...]
                        Sorted and indexed BAM files to analyze. It is
                        essential that all BAM files must be the result of
                        mappings against the same contigs.
  --contigs-and-positions CONTIGS_AND_POS
                        This is the file where you list the contigs, and
                        nucleotide positions you are interested in. This is
                        supposed to be a TAB-delimited file with two columns.
                        In each line, the first column should be the contig
                        name, and the second column should be the comma-
                        separated list of integers for nucleotide positions.
  --only-complete-links
                        When declared, only reads that cover all positions
                        will be reported. It is necessary to use this flag if
                        you want to perform oligotyping-like analyses on
                        matching reads.
  -o FILE_PATH, --output-file FILE_PATH
                        File path to store results.
  --list-contigs        When declared, the program will list contigs in the
                        BAM file and exit gracefully without any further
                        analysis.
```





## anvi-run-hmms

This program deals with populating tables that store HMM hits in an anvi&#39;o
contigs database.





**Usage**

```
anvi-run-hmms [-h] -c CONTIGS_DB [-H HMM PROFILE PATH]
              [-I HMM PROFILE NAME] [-T NUM_THREADS]
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
  -H HMM PROFILE PATH, --hmm-profile-dir HMM PROFILE PATH
                        You can use this parameter you can specify a directory
                        path that contain an HMM profile. This way you can run
                        HMM profiles that are not included in anvi'o. See the
                        online to find out about the specifics of this
                        directory structure .
  -I HMM PROFILE NAME, --installed-hmm-profile HMM PROFILE NAME
                        When you run this program without any parameter, it
                        runs all 4 HMM profiles installed on your system. If
                        you want only a specific one to run, you can select it
                        by using this parameter. These are the currently
                        available ones: "Rinke_et_al" (type: singlecopy),
                        "Campbell_et_al" (type: singlecopy),
                        "BUSCO_83_Protista" (type: singlecopy),
                        "Ribosomal_RNAs" (type: Ribosomal_RNAs).
  -T NUM_THREADS, --num-threads NUM_THREADS
                        Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading

**Example uses and other resources**


* [Tutorial](http://merenlab.org/2018/07/09/anvio-snakemake-workflows/)



**Usage**

```
anvi-run-workflow [-h] [-w WORKFLOW]
                  [--get-default-config OUTPUT_FILENAME]
                  [--list-workflows] [--list-dependencies]
                  [-c CONFIG_FILE] [--dry-run] [--save-workflow-graph]
                  [-A ...]
```

**Parameters**



**ESSENTIAL INPUTS:**   Things you must provide or this won&#39;t work

```
  -w WORKFLOW, --workflow WORKFLOW
                        You must specify a workflow name. To see a list of
                        available workflows run --list-workflows.
```



**ADDITIONAL STUFF:**   additional stuff

```
  --get-default-config OUTPUT_FILENAME
                        Store a json formatted config file with all the
                        default settings of the workflow. This is a good draft
                        you could use in order to write your own config file.
                        This config file contains all parameters that could be
                        configured for this workflow. NOTICE: the config file
                        is provided with default values only for parameters
                        that are set by us in the workflow. The values for the
                        rest of the parameters are determined by the relevant
                        program.
  --list-workflows      Print a list of available snakemake workflows
  --list-dependencies   Print a list of the dependencies of this workflow. You
                        must provide a workflow name and a config file.
                        snakemake will figure out which rules need to be run
                        according to your config file, and according to the
                        files available on your disk. According to the rules
                        that need to be run, we will let you know which
                        programs are going to be used, so that you can make
                        sure you have all of them installed and loaded.
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config-file CONFIG_FILE
                        TBD
  --dry-run             Don't do anything real. Test everything, and stop
                        right before wherever the developer said 'well, this
                        is enough testing', and decided to print out results.
  --save-workflow-graph
                        Save a graph representation of the workflow. If you
                        are using this flag and if your system is unable to
                        generate such graph outputs, you will hear anvi'o
                        complaining (still, totally worth trying).
  -A ..., --additional-params ...
                        Additional snakemake parameters to add when running
                        snakemake. NOTICE: --additional-params HAS TO BE THE
                        LAST ARGUMENT THAT IS PASSED TO anvi-run-workflow,
                        ANYTHING THAT FOLLOWS WILL BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF
                        THE ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS THAT ARE PASSED TO
                        SNAKEMAKE. Any parameter that is accepted by snakemake
                        should be fair game here, but it is your
                        responsibility to make sure that whatever you added
                        makes sense. To see what parameters are available
                        please refer to the snakemake documentation. For
                        example, you could use this to set up cluster
                        submission using --additional-params --cluster "YOUR-
                        CLUSTER-SUBMISSION-CMD"
```





## anvi-saavs-and-protein-structures-summary

Generate a static web site for SAAVs and protein structures.





**Usage**

```
anvi-saavs-and-protein-structures-summary [-h] [-c CONTIGS_DB]
                                          [--genes GENES]
                                          [--samples SAMPLES] -i
                                          DIR_PATH -o DIR_PATH
                                          [--soft-link-images]
                                          [--perspectives PERSPECTIVES]
```

**Parameters**



**CONTIGS DB:**   If you provide a contigs database, anvi&#39;o will findout about functions and
  other properties of genes using the contigs database. This is supposed to
  be the contigs database you used to generate variability profile for this
  project like 2 years ago. Yeah. Time goes by :/

```
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
```



**WHAT SHOULD BE PROCESSED:**   By default, anvi&#39;o will learn about the genes and samples you have from
  the input data directory. If you want to overwrite that information (i.e.
  to work with a smaller set of genes or samples), you can come up with your
  own files.

```
  --genes GENES         Genes file.
  --samples SAMPLES     Samples file.
```



**INPUT/OUTPUT:**   Read from here, write to there.

```
  -i DIR_PATH, --input-dir DIR_PATH
                        Directory path for input files
  -o DIR_PATH, --output-dir DIR_PATH
                        Directory path for output files
```



**ADDITIONAL STUFF:**   Little conveniences.

```
  --soft-link-images    By default, your imaeges will be copied in the output
                        directory to create a fully self-contained output (so
                        you can send it to your colleagues and they would have
                        everything they need to browse the output).
                        Alternatively you can use this flag to avoid copying
                        images in the output directory (it would make the
                        output less portable, but it would take less time and
                        space to generate it).
  --perspectives PERSPECTIVES
                        By default anvi'o will use each perspective found in
                        the data directory to create an HTML output. Using
                        this parameter you can limit perspectives to the ones
                        you are interested in by defining them as a commma-
                        separated list. If you make a mistake anvi'o will tell
                        you what are the available perspectives, so don't
                        worry.
```





## anvi-search-functions

Search functions in an anvi&#39;o contigs database or genomes storage. Basically,
this program searches for one or more search terms you define in functional
annotations of genes in an anvi&#39;o contigs database, and generates multiple
reports. The simpler report (which also is the default one) simply tells you
which contigs contain genes with functions matching to serach terms you used.
This file is only useful to quickly highlight matching contigs in the
interface by providing it to the anvi-interactive with the `--additional-
layer` parameter. You can also request a much more comprehensive report, which
gives you anything you might need to know, including the matching gene caller
id, functional annotation source, and full function name for each hit and
serach term.





**Usage**

```
anvi-search-functions [-h] [-c CONTIGS_DB] [-p PAN_DB]
                      [-g GENOMES_STORAGE] --search-terms SEARCH_TERMS
                      [--delimiter CHAR]
                      [--annotation-sources SOURCE NAME[S]] [-l]
                      [-o FILE_PATH] [--full-report FILE_NAME]
                      [--include-sequences] [--verbose]
```

**Parameters**



**SEARCH IN:**   Relevant source databases

```
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
  -p PAN_DB, --pan-db PAN_DB
                        Anvi'o pan database
  -g GENOMES_STORAGE, --genomes-storage GENOMES_STORAGE
                        Anvi'o genomes storage file
```



**SEARCH FOR:**   Relevant terms

```
  --search-terms SEARCH_TERMS
                        Search terms. Multiple of them can be declared
                        separated by a delimiter (the default is a comma).
  --delimiter CHAR      The delimiter to parse multiple input terms. The
                        default is ','.
  --annotation-sources SOURCE NAME[S]
                        Get functional annotations for a specific list of
                        annotation sources. You can specifiy one or more
                        sources by separating them from each other with a
                        comma character (i.e., '--annotation-sources
                        source_1,source_2,source_3'). The default behavior is
                        to return everything
  -l, --list-annotation-sources
                        List available functional annotation sources.
```



**REPORT:**   Anvi&#39;o can report the hits in multiple ways. The output file will be a
  very simple 2-column TAB-delimited output that is compatible with anvi&#39;o
  additional data format (so you can give it to the `anvi-interactive` to
  see which splits contained genes that were matching to your search terms).
  You can also ask anvi&#39;o to generate a full-report, that contains much more
  and much helpful information about each hit. Optionally you can even ask
  the gene seqeunces to appear in this report.

```
  -o FILE_PATH, --output-file FILE_PATH
                        File path to store results.
  --full-report FILE_NAME
                        Optional output file with a fuller description of
                        findings.
  --include-sequences   Include sequences in the report.
  --verbose             Be verbose, print more messages whenever possible.
```





## anvi-self-test

A script for anvi&#39;o to test itself





**Usage**

```
anvi-self-test [-h] [--suite SUITE]
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  --suite SUITE  Suite of tests to execute. By default this program will
                 execute a full suite of example anvi'o commands to ensure
                 your installation is ready to run all scenarios anvi'o
                 developers could think of. Alternatively you can choose a
                 specific test to run. Here is a full list of available
                 options: mini, full, pangenomics, alons-classifier.
```





## anvi-setup-ncbi-cogs

Download COG data from the NCBI





**Usage**

```
anvi-setup-ncbi-cogs [-h] [--cog-data-dir COG_DATA_DIR] [--reset]
                     [--just-do-it] [-T NUM_THREADS]
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  --cog-data-dir COG_DATA_DIR
                        The directory for COG data to be stored. If you leave
                        it as is without specifying anything, the default
                        destination for the data directory will be used to set
                        things up. The advantage of it is that everyone will
                        be using a single data directory, but then you may
                        need superuser privileges to do it. Using this
                        parameter you can choose the location of the data
                        directory somewhere you like. However, when it is time
                        to run COGs, you will need to remember that path and
                        provide it to the program.
  --reset               This program by default attempts to use previously
                        downloaded files in your COGs data directory if there
                        are any. If something is wrong for some reason you can
                        use this to tell anvi'o to remove everything, and
                        start over.
  --just-do-it          Don't bother me with questions or warnings, just do
                        it.
  -T NUM_THREADS, --num-threads NUM_THREADS
                        Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading
                        whenever possible. Very conservatively, the default is
                        1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number of CPUs
                        / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with
                        this option if you are running your commands on a SGE
                        --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking for
                        multiple threads to use, you may deplete your
                        resources very fast.
```





## anvi-setup-pfams

Download Pfam data from the EBI





**Usage**

```
anvi-setup-pfams [-h] [--pfam-data-dir PFAM_DATA_DIR] [--reset]
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  --pfam-data-dir PFAM_DATA_DIR
                        The directory for Pfam data to be stored. If you leave
                        it as is without specifying anything, the default
                        destination for the data directory will be used to set
                        things up. The advantage of it is that everyone will
                        be using a single data directory, but then you may
                        need superuser privileges to do it. Using this
                        parameter you can choose the location of the data
                        directory somewhere you like. However, when it is time
                        to run Pfam, you will need to remember that path and
                        provide it to the program.
  --reset               This program by default attempts to use previously
                        downloaded files in your Pfam data directory if there
                        are any. If something is wrong for some reason you can
                        use this to tell anvi'o to remove everything, and
                        start over.
```





## anvi-show-collections-and-bins

A script to display collections stored in an anvi&#39;o profile or pan database.





**Usage**

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -p PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB, --pan-or-profile-db PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o pan or profile database (and even genes
                        database in appropriate contexts).
```





## anvi-show-misc-data

Show all misc data keys in all misc data tables





**Usage**

```
anvi-show-misc-data [-h] -p PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB [-t NAME] [-D NAME]
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -p PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB, --pan-or-profile-db PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o pan or profile database (and even genes
                        database in appropriate contexts).
  -t NAME, --target-data-table NAME
                        The target table is the table you are interested in
                        accessing. Currently it can be 'items','layers', or
                        'layer_orders'. Please see most up-to-date online
                        documentation for more information.
  -D NAME, --target-data-group NAME
                        Data group to focus. Anvi'o misc data tables support
                        associating a set of data keys with a data group. If
                        you have no idea what this is, then probably you don't
                        need it, and anvi'o will take care of you. Note: this
                        flag is IRRELEVANT if you are working with additioanl
                        order data tables.

## anvi-split

Split an anvi&#39;o profile into smaller profiles. This is usually great when you
want to share a subset of an anvi&#39;o profile. You give this guy an anvi&#39;o
profile databsae, a contigs database, and a collection id, and it gives you
back directories of profiles for each bin that can be treated as individual
anvi&#39;o profiles.





**Usage**

```
anvi-split [-h] -p PROFILE_DB -c CONTIGS_DB [-C COLLECTION_NAME]
           [-b BIN_NAME] [-o DIR_PATH] [--list-collections]
           [--skip-hierarchical-clustering] [--skip-variability-tables]
           [--compress-auxiliary-data]
           [--enforce-hierarchical-clustering]
           [--distance DISTANCE_METRIC] [--linkage LINKAGE_METHOD]
```

**Parameters**



**DATABASES:**   Declaring relevant anvi&#39;o databases. First things first.

```
  -p PROFILE_DB, --profile-db PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o profile database
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
```



**COLLECTION:**   You should provide a valid collection name. If you do not provide bin
  names, the program will generate an output for each bin in your collection
  separately.

```
  -C COLLECTION_NAME, --collection-name COLLECTION_NAME
                        Collection name.
  -b BIN_NAME, --bin-id BIN_NAME
                        Bin name you are interested in.
```



**OUTPUT:**   Where do we want the resulting split profiles to be stored.

```
  -o DIR_PATH, --output-dir DIR_PATH
                        Directory path for output files
```



**EXTRAS:**   Stuff that you rarely need, but you really really need when the time
  comes. Following parameters will aply to each of the resulting anvi&#39;o
  profile that will be split from the mother anvi&#39;o profile.

```
  --list-collections    Show available collections and exit.
  --skip-hierarchical-clustering
                        If you are not planning to use the interactive
                        interface (or if you have other means to add a tree of
                        contigs in the database) you may skip the step where
                        hierarchical clustering of your items are preformed
                        based on default clustering recipes matching to your
                        database type.
  --skip-variability-tables
                        Processing variability tables in profile databse might
                        take a very very long time. With this flag you will be
                        asking anvi'o to skip them.
  --compress-auxiliary-data
                        When declared, the auxiliary data file in the
                        resulting output will be compressed. This saves space,
                        but it takes long. Also, if you are planning to
                        compress the entire later using GZIP, it is even
                        useless to do. But you are the boss!
  --enforce-hierarchical-clustering
                        If you have more than 25,000 splits in your merged
                        profile, anvi-merge will automatically skip the
                        hierarchical clustering of splits (by setting --skip-
                        hierarchical-clustering flag on). This is due to the
                        fact that computational time required for hierarchical
                        clustering increases exponentially with the number of
                        items being clustered. Based on our experience we
                        decided that 25,000 splits is about the maximum we
                        should try. However, this is not a theoretical limit,
                        and you can overwrite this heuristic by using this
                        flag, which would tell anvi'o to attempt to cluster
                        splits regardless.
  --distance DISTANCE_METRIC
                        The distance metric for the hierarchical clustering.
                        If you do not use this flag, the default distance
                        metric will be used for each clustering configuration
                        which is "euclidean".
  --linkage LINKAGE_METHOD
                        The same story with the `--distance`, except, the
                        system default for this one is ward.
```





## anvi-summarize

Summarize an anvi&#39;o collection. Fun stuff.





**Usage**

```
anvi-summarize [-h] -p PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB [-c CONTIGS_DB]
               [-g GENOMES_STORAGE] [--init-gene-coverages]
               [-C COLLECTION_NAME] [-o DIR_PATH] [--list-collections]
               [--taxonomic-level {t_phylum,t_class,t_order,t_family,t_genus,t_species}]
               [--cog-data-dir COG_DATA_DIR] [--quick-summary]
               [--just-do-it] [--report-aa-seqs-for-gene-calls]
```

**Parameters**



**PROFILE:**   The profile. It could be a standard or pan profile database.

```
  -p PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB, --pan-or-profile-db PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o pan or profile database (and even genes
                        database in appropriate contexts).
```



**PROFILE TYPE SPECIFIC PARAMETERS:**   If you are summarizing a collection stored in a standard anvi&#39;o profile,
  you will need a contigs database to go with it. If you are working with a
  pan profile, then you will need to provide a genomes storage. Don&#39;t worry
  too much, because anvi&#39;o will warn you gently if you make a mistake.

```
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
  -g GENOMES_STORAGE, --genomes-storage GENOMES_STORAGE
                        Anvi'o genomes storage file
```



**STANDARD PROFILE SPECIFIC PARAMS:**   Parameters that are only relevant to standard profile summaries (declaring
  or not declaring them will not change anything if you are summarizing a
  pan profile).

```
  --init-gene-coverages
                        Initialize gene coverage and detection data. This is a
                        very computationally expensive step, but it is
                        necessary when you need gene level coverage data. The
                        reason this is very computationally expensive is
                        because anvi'o computes gene coverages by going back
                        to actual coverage values of each gene to average
                        them, instead of using contig average coverage values,
                        for extreme accuracy.
  --report-aa-seqs-for-gene-calls
                        You can use this flag if you would like to find
                        translated DNA sequences for your gene calls in the
                        genes output file.
```



**COMMONS:**   Common parameters for both pan and standard profile summaries.

```
  -C COLLECTION_NAME, --collection-name COLLECTION_NAME
                        Collection name.
  -o DIR_PATH, --output-dir DIR_PATH
                        Directory path for output files
  --list-collections    Show available collections and exit.
  --taxonomic-level {t_phylum,t_class,t_order,t_family,t_genus,t_species}
                        The taxonomic level to use. The default is 't_genus'.
                        Only relevant if the anvi'o ontigs database contains
                        taxonomic annotations.
  --cog-data-dir COG_DATA_DIR
                        The directory path for your COG setup. Anvi'o will try
                        to use the default path if you do not specify
                        anything.
  --quick-summary       When declared the summary output will be generated as
                        quickly as possible, with minimum amount of essential
                        information about bins.
```



**EXTRA:**   Extra stuff because you&#39;re extra.

```
  --just-do-it          Don't bother me with questions or warnings, just do
                        it.
```





## anvi-update-db-description

                                        [--modeller-executable MODELLER_EXECUTABLE]
                                        [--skip-genes-if-already-present]
```

**Parameters**



**DATABASES:**   Declaring relevant anvi&#39;o databases. First things first.

```
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
  -s STRUCTURE_DB, --structure-db STRUCTURE_DB
                        Anvi'o structure database.
```



**GENES:**   Specifying which genes you want to be modelled.

```
  --genes-to-remove GENES_TO_REMOVE, -r GENES_TO_REMOVE
                        Gene caller ids to remove from your structure
                        database. Multiple of them can be declared by
                        separating with comma (e.g. --genes-to-remove
                        2,4,5,6).
  --genes-to-remove-file GENES_TO_REMOVE_FILE, -R GENES_TO_REMOVE_FILE
                        A file of gene caller ids to remove from your
                        structure database. Each line in the file should be a
                        gene caller id.
  --genes-to-add GENES_TO_ADD, -a GENES_TO_ADD
                        Gene caller ids to remove from your structure
                        database. Multiple of them can be declared by
                        separating with comma (e.g. --genes-to-add 2,4,5,6).
  --genes-to-add-file GENES_TO_ADD_FILE, -A GENES_TO_ADD_FILE
                        A file of gene caller ids to remove from your
                        structure database. Each line in the file should be a
                        gene caller id.
```



**OUTPUT:**   Output file and output style.

```
  --dump-dir DUMP_DIR   Modelling and annotating structures requires a lot of
                        moving parts, each which have their own outputs. The
                        output of this program is a structure database
                        containing the pertinent results of this computation,
                        however a lot of stuff doesn't make the cut. By
                        providing a directory for this parameter you will get,
                        in addition to the structure database, a directory
                        containing the raw output for everything.
```



**MODELLER EXECUTABLE:**   Which executable program to use for MODELLER, e.g. mod9.19

```
  --modeller-executable MODELLER_EXECUTABLE
                        The MODELLER program to use. For example, `mod9.19`.
                        The default is `mod9.19`
```



**MISCALLANEOUS:**   Other stuff

```
  --skip-genes-if-already-present
                        If you try to add a gene that is already present,
                        instead of complaining it will be skipped.
```





## anvi-upgrade

Download and install minor releases of anvi&#39;o from a Github repository.





**Usage**

```
anvi-upgrade [-h] [--repository REPOSITORY]
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  --repository REPOSITORY
                        Source repository to download releases, currently only
                        Github is supported. Enter in 'merenlab/anvio' format.
```





## anvi-script-add-default-collection

A script to add a &#39;DEFAULT&#39; collection in an anvi&#39;o pan or profile database
with a bin named &#39;EVERYTHING&#39; that describes all items available in the
profile databse.





**Usage**

```
anvi-script-add-default-collection [-h] -p PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB
                                   [-c CONTIGS_DB]
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -p PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB, --pan-or-profile-db PAN_OR_PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o pan or profile database (and even genes
                        database in appropriate contexts).
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
```





## anvi-script-calculate-pn-ps-ratio

Extract information for variable positions





**Usage**

```
anvi-script-calculate-pn-ps-ratio [-h] [-a SAAV_TABLE] [-b SCV_TABLE]
                                  -c CONTIGS_DB [-j FLOAT]
                                  [-i MINIMUM_NUM_VARIANTS]
                                  [-m MIN_COVERAGE] -o DIR_PATH
```

**Parameters**



**VARIABILITY:**   Two variability tables generated from anvi-gen-variability-table are
  required. One of SAAVs (generated with --engine AA) and one of SCVs
  (generated with --engine CDN). They must be generated with the same
  profile database and the exact same set of genes in the contigs database.
  To be safe, it is highly recommended you use the same settings during both
  commands except for changing --engine AA to --engine CDN and the output
  filename.

```
  -a SAAV_TABLE, --saav-table SAAV_TABLE
                        Filepath to the SAAV table.
  -b SCV_TABLE, --scv-table SCV_TABLE
                        Filepath to the SCV table.
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Filepath to the contigs database used to generate
                        variability tables.
```



**OUTPUT:**   The output of this program is a folder directory with several tables.

```
  -o DIR_PATH, --output-dir DIR_PATH
                        Directory path for output files
```



**TUNABLES:**   Successfully tune one or more of these parameters to unlock the &quot;Advanced
  anvi&#39;an&quot; achievement.

```
  -j FLOAT, --min-departure-from-consensus FLOAT
                        Variants (either SCVs or SAAVs) will be ignored if
                        they have a departure from consensus less than this
                        value. Note: Keep in mind you may have already
                        supplied this parameter during anvi-gen-variability-
                        profile. Default is 0.1.
  -i MINIMUM_NUM_VARIANTS, --minimum-num-variants MINIMUM_NUM_VARIANTS
                        Ignore genes with less than this number of single
                        codon variants. This avoids being impressed by pN/pS
                        values of infinite, when really all that happened was
                        a gene had 1 SAAV and 0 synonymous SCVs. The default
                        is 4 to ensure some level of statistical importance.
  -m MIN_COVERAGE, --min-coverage MIN_COVERAGE
                        If the coverage value at a codon is less than this
                        amount, any SAAVs or SCVs associated with it will be
                        ignored.
```

**optional arguments:** 

```
  -f FASTA, --fasta-file FASTA
                        A FASTA-formatted input file
  -o DIR_PATH, --output-dir DIR_PATH

  -p PAN_DB, --pan-db PAN_DB
                        Anvi'o pan database
  -T NUM_THREADS, --num-threads NUM_THREADS
                        Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading
                        whenever possible. Very conservatively, the default is
                        1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number of CPUs
                        / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with
                        this option if you are running your commands on a SGE

  --log-file FILE_PATH  File path to store debug/output messages.
  --method {ANIm,ANIb,ANIblastall,TETRA}
                        Method for pyANI. The default is ANIb. You must have
                        the necessary binary in path for whichever method you
                        choose. According to the pyANI help for v0.2.7 at
                        https://github.com/widdowquinn/pyani, the method
                        'ANIm' uses MUMmer (NUCmer) to align the input
                        sequences. 'ANIb' uses BLASTN+ to align 1020nt
                        fragments of the input sequences. 'ANIblastall': uses
                        the legacy BLASTN to align 1020nt fragments Finally,
                        'TETRA': calculates tetranucleotide frequencies of
                        each input sequence
  --distance DISTANCE_METRIC
                        The distance metric for the hierarchical clustering.

  --linkage LINKAGE_METHOD
                        The linkage method for the hierarchical clustering.
                        The default is "ward".

## anvi-script-filter-fasta-by-blast

Filter FASTA file according to BLAST table (remove sequences with bad BLAST
alignment.





**Usage**

```
anvi-script-filter-fasta-by-blast [-h] [-f FASTA] [-o FILE_PATH] -b
                                  BLAST_OUTPUT -s OUTFMT -t THRESHOLD
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -f FASTA, --fasta-file FASTA
                        A FASTA-formatted input file
  -o FILE_PATH, --output-file FILE_PATH
                        File path to store results.
  -b BLAST_OUTPUT, --blast-output BLAST_OUTPUT
                        BLAST table generated with blastp. `--outfmt 6` as the
                        output format is assumed.
  -s OUTFMT, --outfmt OUTFMT
                        Specify the column ordering of your BLAST report. We
                        add the following paramter to our BLAST searches so
                        the output report contains the `qlen` field, which is
                        not included by default: `-outfmt '6 qseqid sseqid
                        pident length mismatch gapopen qstart qend sstart send
                        evalue bitscore qlen slen'`. You may have used a
                        different `-outfmt` paramter, and you should use this
                        parameter to explicitly define the column names in
                        your output file. For instance, if you had used the
                        parameter mentioned above, then the correct version of
                        this parameter would be: "qseqid sseqid pident length
                        mismatch gapopen qstart qend sstart send evalue
                        bitscore qlen slen". Regardless of the BLAST output
                        format, your columns MUST contain the following
                        parameters for this program to work properly:
                        'qseqid', 'bitscore', 'length', 'qlen', and 'pident'.
  -t THRESHOLD, --threshold THRESHOLD
                        What `proper_pident` threshold do you want to use for
                        filtering out sequences whose top bit-score matches
                        have `proper_pident`s less than this threshold? We
                        have defined `proper_pident` to be the percentage of
                        the query amino acids that both aligned to and were
                        identical to the corresponding matched amino acid.
                        Note that the `pident` parameter output by BLAST does
                        not include regions of the query sequence unaligned to
                        the matched sequence, whereas `proper_pident` does.
                        For example, a sequence that's only half aligned by a
                        match but with 100% identity at matched regions has a
                        `pident` of 100 but a `proper_pident` of 50. The
                        default is 30.0%.

                                               [-p PROFILE_DB]
                                               [-C COLLECTION_NAME]

                                               [--min-detection FLOAT]
                                               [--fraction-of-median-coverage FLOAT]
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
  -p PROFILE_DB, --profile-db PROFILE_DB
                        Anvi'o profile database
  -C COLLECTION_NAME, --collection-name COLLECTION_NAME
                        Collection name.
  -b BIN_NAME, --bin-id BIN_NAME
                        Bin name you are interested in.
  --min-detection FLOAT
                        For this entire thing to work, the genome you are
                        focusing on should be detected in at least one
                        metagenome. If that is not the case, it would mean
                        that you do not have any sample that represents the
                        niche for this organism (or you do not have enough
                        depth of coverage) to investigate the detection of
                        genes in the environment. By default, this script
                        requires at least '0.5' of the genome to be detected
                        in at least one metagenome. This parameter allows you
                        to change that. 0 would mean no detection test
                        required, 1 would mean the entire genome must be
                        detected.
  --fraction-of-median-coverage FLOAT
                        The value set here will be used to remove a gene if
                        its total coverage across environments is less than
                        the median coverage of all genes multiplied by this
                        value. The default is 0.25, which means, if the median
                        total coverage of all genes across all samples is
                        100X, then, a gene with a total coverage of less than
                        25X across all samples will be assumed not a part of
                        the 'environmental core'.

## anvi-script-get-short-reads-matching-something

You give this program one or more FASTQ files and a short sequence, and it
returns all short reads from the FASTQ file that matches to it. The purpose of
this is to get back short reads that may be extending into hypervariable
regions of genomes, resulting a decreased mappability of short reads in the
metagenome given a reference. You often see those areas of genomes as
significant dips in coverage, and in most cases with a large number of SNVs.
When you provide the downstream conserved sequence, this program allows you to
take a better look at those regions at the short read level without any
mapping.





**Usage**

```
anvi-script-get-short-reads-matching-something [-h] --match-sequence

## anvi-script-process-genbank

This script takes a GenBank file, and outputs a FASTA file, as well as two
additional TAB-delimited output files for external gene calls and gene
functions that can be used with the programs `anvi-gen-contigs-database` and
`anvi-import-functions`.

```
  -O FILENAME_PREFIX, --output-file-prefix FILENAME_PREFIX
                        A prefix to be used while naming the output files (no
                        file type extensions please; just a prefix).

## anvi-script-process-genbank-metadata

This script takes the &#39;metadata&#39; output of the program `ncbi-genome-download`
(see https://github.com/kblin/ncbi-genome-download for details), and processes
each GenBank file found in the metadata file to generate a FASTA file, as well
as genes and functions files for each entry. Plus, it autmatically generates a
FASTA TXT file descriptor for anvi&#39;o snakemake workfloes. So it is a multi-
talented program like that.





**Usage**

```
anvi-script-process-genbank-metadata [-h] -m METADATA [-o DIR_PATH]
                                     [--output-fasta-txt OUTPUT_FASTA_TXT]
```

**Parameters**



**INPUT:**   Give us the preciousss...

```
  -m METADATA, --metadata METADATA
                        This is the file you get from the program `ncbi-
                        genome-download` when you use the parameter
                        `--metadata-table`.
```



**OUTPUT:**   Where to find your precioussesss...

```
  -o DIR_PATH, --output-dir DIR_PATH
                        Directory path for output files
  --output-fasta-txt OUTPUT_FASTA_TXT
                        This is not a FASTA file, but a TAB-delimited file
                        with all the file names and paths processed by this
                        program. This output can directly go into the anvi'o
                        snakemake workflows because magic.
```





## anvi-script-reformat-fasta

Reformat FASTA file (remove contigs based on length, or based on a given list
of deflines, and/or generate an output with simpler names)





**Usage**

```
anvi-script-reformat-fasta [-h] [-l MIN_LENGTH] [-i TXT FILE]
                           [-I TXT FILE] -o FASTA FILE
                           [--simplify-names] [--prefix PREFIX]
                           [-r REPORT FILE]
                           contigs_fasta
```

**Parameters**



**positional arguments:** 

```
  contigs_fasta
```



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -l MIN_LENGTH, --min-len MIN_LENGTH
                        Minimum length of contigs to keep (contigs shorter
                        than this value will not be included in the output
                        file). The default is 0, so nothing will be removed if
                        you do not declare a minimum size.
  -i TXT FILE, --exclude-ids TXT FILE
                        IDs to remove from the FASTA file. You cannot provide
                        both --keep-ids and --exclude-ids.
  -I TXT FILE, --keep-ids TXT FILE
                        If provided, all IDs not in this file will be excluded
                        from the reformatted FASTA file. Any additional
                        filters (such as --min-len) will still be applied to
                        the IDs in this file. You cannot provide both
                        --exclude-ids and --keep-ids.
  -o FASTA FILE, --output-file FASTA FILE
                        Output file path.
  --simplify-names      Edit deflines to make sure they contigs have simple
                        names.
  --prefix PREFIX       Use this parameter if you would like to add a prefix
                        to your contig names while simplifying them. The
                        prefix must be a single word (you can use underscor
                        character, but nothing more!).
  -r REPORT FILE, --report-file REPORT FILE
                        Report file path. When you run this program with
                        `--simplify-names` flag, all changes to deflines will
                        be reported in this file in case you need to go back
                        to this information later. It is not mandatory to
                        declare one, but it is a very good idea to have it.
```





## anvi-script-run-eggnog-mapper

**Usage**

```
anvi-script-run-eggnog-mapper [-h] -c CONTIGS_DB
                              [--cog-data-dir COG_DATA_DIR]
                              [-T NUM_THREADS]
                              [--drop-previous-annotations]
                              [--annotation EMAPPER_ANNOTATION_FILE]
                              [--use-version EMAPPER_VERSION]
```

**Parameters**



**optional arguments:** 

```
  -c CONTIGS_DB, --contigs-db CONTIGS_DB
                        Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen-
                        contigs'
  --cog-data-dir COG_DATA_DIR
                        The directory path for your COG setup if you did not
                        use the default directory.
  -T NUM_THREADS, --num-threads NUM_THREADS
                        Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading
                        whenever possible. Very conservatively, the default is
                        1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number of CPUs
                        / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with
                        this option if you are running your commands on a SGE
                        --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking for
                        multiple threads to use, you may deplete your
                        resources very fast.
  --drop-previous-annotations
                        When declared, previous annotations in the database
                        will be dropped.
  --annotation EMAPPER_ANNOTATION_FILE
                        If you have an annotation file from a previous run,
                        you can call this program to import the contents of
                        that file into the database instead of a run from
                        scratch. In that case, you must also use the `--use-
                        version` parameter to clarify which parser version
                        should be used to parse it.
  --use-version EMAPPER_VERSION
                        The version of eggnog-mapper that generated the
                        annotation file.
